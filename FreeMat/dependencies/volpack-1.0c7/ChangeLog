1.0-beta3 - most current Stanford release

--------------- Released version 1.0 beta1 ---------------

1. Bug Fix: vpCreateMinMaxOctree caused a segmentation fault for
   volume sizes that were not a power of two.

2. Debug Feature: Added debugging code for compositing calculation.

3. Debug Feature: Added intermediate image coordinates to vpTracePixel
   output.

4. Bug Fix: Added a check in vpRamp for non-increasing x coordinates
   to prevent a divide-by-zero error.

5. Bug Fix: Added a version of the compositing routine (vp_compAn.m4)
   that does not have unrolled loops, since some compilers have
   trouble with the unrolled version (too many basic blocks to run the
   optimizer in a reasonable amount of time).  The unrolled version is
   now in vp_compAu.m4 instead of vp_compA.m4.  The Makefile can be
   modified to choose one or the other version.

6. Feature: Added complete man pages for all library routines.

7. Bug Fix: In vpSetCallback, revert to default behavior if the function
   argument is NULL (instead of causing a NULL dereference later on).

8. Feature: Added vpStoreContext and vpLoadContext to save and restore
   rendering contexts (and to make it easier to reproduce bugs).

9. Feature: Changed vpLoadRawVolume to memory-map the file if
   requested

10. Bug Fix: Fixed missing and incorrect function prototypes.

11. Feature: Changed makefile and headers to use GNU autoconf.

--------------- Released version 1.0 beta2 ---------------

12. Bug Fix: Fixed minus-sign error in formula for depth cueing factor.
    This eliminates the brightness changes that occurred when rotating
    a volume past a 45 degree point with depth cueing enabled.

13. Debug Feature: Added code to collect rendering statistics for
    performance analysis.

14. Debug Feature: Allow negative opacity threshold (to experiment with
    disabling the benefit of spatial data structures).

15. Bug Fix: Fixed the result of vpGeti with the VP_VIEW_Y_SIZE
    or VP_VIEW_Z_SIZE options.

16. Reorganization and renaming of compositing functions to make it
    easier to conditionally compile in just some of the special-case
    versions.  Also merged code for unrolled loops with code for
    non-unrolled loops into one M4 source file.

17. Feature: Added experimental "index volume" code for faster
    early-ray termination.

18. Debug Feature: Added define flags to conditionally remove early-ray
    termination and resampling loops for performance analysis runs.

19. Feature: Added experimental brute-force raycaster for performance
    comparisons.

20. Feature: Implemented shadows.

21. Bug Fix: Added missing return value in vpDestroyClassifiedVolume.

22. Feature: Implemented resampling filters for scaling volume data
    (vpSetFilter(), vpResample(), vpBoxFilter(), vpLinearFilter(),
    vpBicubicFilter(), vpGaussianFilter()).

23. Feature: Added capability to produce images with a variety of
    pixel formats, including an optional alpha channel.
    *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE TO vpSetImage ***

24. Feature: Changed vpGetImage to produce images with the same
    pixel formats supported by vpSetImage, and to allow reading back
    the shadow buffer.
    *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE TO vpGetImage ***

25. Reorganized macros in vp_compA.m4 and vp_warpA.m4.

26. Bug Fix: Refactor view if shadows are turned on.

27. Feature: The callback functions for VP_LOG_ALLOC_FUNC,
    VP_LOG_FREE_FUNC and VP_STATUS_FUNC now get one additional
    argument, the client_data pointer associated with the context.

28. Bug Fix: Check if intermediate image buffer must be resized
    even if view has not changed (since number of color channels
    may be different).

29. Feature: Allow clamping to be disabled when computing shading
    lookup table (vpShadeTable).

30. Debug Feature: Added options to override default compositing direction
    and to retrieve compositing order.

31. Bug Fix: Check for invalid voxel field sizes when using lookup
    table shading.

32. Bug Fix: Don't destroy classified volume when raw voxel array
    is set to NULL pointer.

33. Bug Fix: Fixed error in vpNormalIndex (also affecting
    vpScanlineNormals and vpVolumeNormals) that resulted in incorrect
    calculation of isolated surface normals due to a roundoff error.
    This sometimes also resulted in index values greater than the
    maximum permissible value.
