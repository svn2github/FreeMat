.TH vpGetError 3 "" VolPack
.SH NAME
vpGetError, vpGetErrorString \- retrieve error codes
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <volpack.h>
.sp
.FS vpResult
\fBvpGetError(\fIvpc\fB)\fR
.FA
vpContext *\fIvpc;\fR
.FE
.sp
.FS "char *"
\fBvpGetErrorString(\fIcode\fB)\fR
.FA
vpResult \fIcode;\fR
.FE
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIvpc\fR
VolPack context from \fBvpCreateContext.\fR
.IP \fIcode\fR
A VolPack error result code.
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines are used for error handling.  \fBvpGetError\fR return
the error code from the first function call that failed since the last
call to \fBvpGetError\fR.  \fBvpGetErrorString\fR returns a
descriptive string corresponding to an error code.  The string is
stored in a global array so it does not need to be copied to separate
memory.
.SH ERRORS
\fBvpGetError\fR cannot fail.  A return value not equal to VP_OK means
that some previous function call has failed.  \fBvpGetErrorString\fR
returns NULL if \fIcode\fB is invalid.
