.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to load volume data structures into a
rendering context from files in the format written by the VolPack file
storing routines (see vpStoreRawVolume(3)).
.PP
\fBvpLoadRawVolume\fR loads a 3D voxel array file.  The file includes
information about the size of the volume and the layout of the voxels
as well as the volume data itself.  A new voxel array is allocated,
the data is read into the array, and the array is stored in the
rendering context.  Note that the array will not be freed
automatically when the context is destroyed; the application is
responsible for freeing the array when appropriate (by using
\fBvpGetp\fR with the VP_VOXEL_DATA state variable code to retrieve
the array pointer), or for unmapping the voxel array if it has been
memory mapped (see below).
.PP
Any existing min-max octree or preclassified volume data is destroyed
when \fBvpLoadRawVolume\fR is called.  The information loaded from the
file includes all of the parameters set with \fBvpSetVolumeSize\fR,
\fBvpSetVoxelSize\fR, \fBvpSetVoxelField\fR and \fBvpSetRawVoxels\fR.
The data in the file is automatically byte-swapped if the file was
written on an architecture with different byte ordering than the
current architecture.  A magic constant in the file is used to
determine if byte-swapping is necessary.  Volume fields that have not
been explicitly declared (by calling \fBvpSetVoxelField\fR before
storing the voxel array file) cannot be byte-swapped.
.PP
\fBvpLoadMinMaxOctree\fR loads a min-max octree file.  The current 3D
voxel array size and voxel layout must match the data in the octree
file before the file is loaded; consistency checks are performed.  Any
existing octree is destroyed and the new octree is stored in the
rendering context.  Byte-swapping is performed if necessary.
.PP
\fBvpLoadClassifiedVolume\fR loads a preclassified volume data file.
The file includes information about the size of the volume and the
layout of the voxels as well as the volume data itself.  If the volume
matches the size and layout of any existing volume data in the
rendering context then the data in the file replaces only the current
preclassified volume; otherwise, the old octree is destroyed, the
3D voxel array parameters are zeroed out, and the new size and layout
parameters are loaded.  The information loaded from the file includes
all of the parameters set with \fBvpSetVolumeSize\fR,
\fBvpSetVoxelSize\fR and \fBvpSetVoxelField\fR.  Byte-swapping is
performed if necessary.
.PP
\fBvpLoadContext\fR loads a rendering context file.  The file includes
all rendering parameters except volume data and callback functions.
The contents of any lookup tables for shading and classification are
also loaded.  Any existing preclassified volume data or octree are
destroyed and the 3D voxel array parameters pointer is zeroed out.
The lookup tables are loaded into dynamically allocated arrays, and
the application is responsible for freeing those array when necessary;
the arrays are not automatically freed when \fBvpDestroyContext\fR is
called.  In the current implementation byte swapping is not performed
so context files from other architectures cannot be read.
.PP
The function used to read data from the files can be set by calling
\fBvpSetCallback\fR with the VP_READ_FUNC option.  This could be used
to implement a file-compression system, for example.  It is also
possible to memory-map data from files by setting the VP_MMAP_FUNC
option.  If this function is set then large data structures are memory
mapped from files instead of being copied into memory, when possible.
Data that must be byte-swapped cannot be memory mapped.  Memory
mapping has the advantages that less swap space is required and data
is loaded into memory only as it is used.
.SH "STATE VARIABLES"
The current file I/O parameters can be retrieved with the following
state variable codes (see vpGeti(3)): VP_READ_FUNC, VP_MMAP_FUNC.
.SH ERRORS
The normal return value is VP_OK.  The following error return values
are possible:
.IP VPERROR_IO
The file reading or memory mapping function returned an error value
(in which case the external variable \fBerrno\fR should contain an
operating-system specific error code), or the end of the file was
reached prematurely.
.IP VPERROR_BAD_FILE
The data in the file is invalid, usually meaning that it isn't a file
written by the appropriate VolPack function.
.IP VPERROR_BAD_VOLUME
The data in a min-max octree file does not match the current volume
size (\fBvpLoadMinMaxOctree\fR only).
.IP VPERROR_BAD_VOXEL
The data in a min-max octree file does not match the current voxel
layout parameters (\fBvpLoadMinMaxOctree\fR only).
