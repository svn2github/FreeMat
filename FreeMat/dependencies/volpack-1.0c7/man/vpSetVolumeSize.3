.TH vpSetVolumeSize 3 "" VolPack
.SH NAME
vpSetVolumeSize \- define the dimensions of a volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <volpack.h>
.sp
.FS vpResult
\fBvpSetVolumeSize(\fIvpc, xlen, ylen, zlen\fB)\fR
.FA
vpContext *\fIvpc;\fR
.FA
int \fIxlen, ylen, zlen;\fR
.FE
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIvpc\fR
VolPack context from \fBvpCreateContext.\fR
.IP \fIxlen\fR
Size of first dimension of the volume in voxels.
.IP \fIylen\fR
Size of the second dimension of the volume in voxels.
.IP \fIzlen\fR
Size of the third dimension of the volume in voxels.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvpSetVolumeSize\fR is used to define the dimensions of a volume.
It must be called before volume data is loaded into a rendering
context.  Any existing precomputed volume data structures in the
context are destroyed.
.SH "STATE VARIABLES"
The current volume dimensions may be retrieved with the following
state variable codes (see vpGeti(3)): VP_XLEN, VP_YLEN, VP_ZLEN. 
.SH ERRORS
The return value is always VP_OK.
