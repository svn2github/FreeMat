 * The ef_expand_file() function expands a specified pathname, converting

 *
 * If no errors occur, a container is returned containing the array of

 * in the input pathname, this will contain just the original pathname
 * after expansion of ~ and $ expressions. If there were any wildcards,
 * then the array will contain the files that matched them. Note that
 * if there were any wildcards but no existing files match them, this
 * is counted as an error and NULL is returned.
 *
 * The supported wildcards and their meanings are:
 *  *        -  Match any sequence of zero or more characters.
 *  ?        -  Match any single character.
 *  [chars]  -  Match any single character that appears in 'chars'.
 *              If 'chars' contains an expression of the form a-b,

 *              of the sequence of characters.
 *  [^chars] -  The same as [chars] except that it matches any single
 *              character that doesn't appear in 'chars'.
 *
 * Wildcard expressions are applied to individual filename components.
 * They don't match across directory separators. A '.' character at
 * the beginning of a filename component must also be matched
 * explicitly by a '.' character in the input pathname, since these
 * are UNIX's hidden files.
 *
 * Input:
 *  fe         ExpandFile *  The pathname expansion resource object.
 *  path       const char *  The path name to be expanded.
