FreeMat assignments take a number of different forms, depending 
on the type of the variable you want to make an assignment to.
For numerical arrays and strings, the form of an assignment
is either
<PRE>
  a(ndx) = val
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>ndx</code> is a set of vector indexing coordinates.  This means
that the values <code>ndx</code> takes reference the elements of <code>a</code> in column
order.  So, if, for example <code>a</code> is an <code>N x M</code> matrix, the first column
has vector indices <code>1,2,...,N</code>, and the second column has indices
<code>N+1,N+2,...,2N</code>, and so on.  Alternately, you can use multi-dimensional
indexing to make an assignment:
<PRE>
  a(ndx_1,ndx_2,..,ndx_m) = val
</PRE>
<P>
where each indexing expression <code>ndx_i</code> corresponds to the <code>i-th</code> dimension
of <code>a</code>.  In both cases, (vector or multi-dimensional indexing), the
right hand side <code>val</code> must either be a scalar, an empty matrix, or of the
same size as the indices.  If <code>val</code> is an empty matrix, the assignment acts
like a delete.  Note that the type of <code>a</code> may be modified by the assignment.
So, for example, assigning a <code>double</code> value to an element of a <code>float</code> 
array <code>a</code> will cause the array <code>a</code> to become <code>double</code>.  

For cell arrays, the above forms of assignment will still work, but only
if <code>val</code> is also a cell array.  If you want to assign the contents of
a cell in a cell array, you must use one of the two following forms, either
<PRE>
  a{ndx} = val
</PRE>
<P>
or
<PRE>
  a{ndx_1,ndx_2,...,ndx_m} = val
</PRE>
<P>
which will modify the contents of the cell.
