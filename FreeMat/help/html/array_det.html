<H2>DET Determinant of a Matrix
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_array.html> Array Generation and Manipulations </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Calculates the determinant of a matrix.  Note that for all but
very small problems, the determinant is not particularly useful.
The condition number <code>cond</code> gives a more reasonable estimate as
to the suitability of a matrix for inversion than comparing <code>det(A)</code>
to zero.  In any case, the syntax for its use is
<PRE>
  y = det(A)
</PRE>
<P>
where A is a square matrix.
<H3>Function Internals</H3>
The determinant is calculated via the <code>LU</code> decomposition.  Note that
the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of the 
determinants.  Then, we have that 
<P>

<P>
where <code>L</code> is lower triangular with 1s on the main diagonal, <code>U</code> is
upper triangular, and <code>P</code> is a row-permutation matrix.  Taking the
determinant of both sides yields
<P>

</DIV>
<P>
where we have used the fact that the determinant of <code>L</code> is 1.  The
determinant of <code>P</code> (which is a row exchange matrix) is either 1 or 
-1.
<H3>Example</H3>
Here we assemble a random matrix and compute its determinant
<PRE>
--&gt; A = rand(5);
--&gt; det(A)

ans = 
   -0.1160 
</PRE>
<P>
Then, we exchange two rows of <code>A</code> to demonstrate how the determinant
changes sign (but the magnitude is the same)
<PRE>
--&gt; B = A([2,1,3,4,5],:);
--&gt; det(B)

ans = 
    0.1160 
</PRE>
