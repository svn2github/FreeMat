<H2>RESHAPE Reshape An Array

Section: <A HREF=sec_array.html> Array Generation and Manipulations </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Reshapes an array from one size to another. Two seperate 
syntaxes are possible.  The first syntax specifies the array 
dimensions as a sequence of scalar dimensions:
<PRE>
   y = reshape(x,d1,d2,...,dn).
</PRE>
<P>
The resulting array has the given dimensions, and is filled with
the contents of <code>x</code>.  The type of <code>y</code> is the same as <code>x</code>.  
The second syntax specifies the array dimensions as a vector,
where each element in the vector specifies a dimension length:
<PRE>
   y = reshape(x,[d1,d2,...,dn]).
</PRE>
<P>
This syntax is more convenient for calling <code>reshape</code> using a 
variable for the argument. The
<code>reshape</code> function requires that the length of <code>x</code> equal the product
of the <code>di</code> values.
Note that arrays are stored in column format, 
which means that elements in <code>x</code> are transferred to the new array
<code>y</code> starting with the first column first element, then proceeding to 
the last element of the first column, then the first element of the
second column, etc.
<H3>Example</H3>
Here are several examples of the use of <code>reshape</code> applied to
various arrays.  The first example reshapes a row vector into a 
matrix.
<PRE>
--&gt; a = uint8(1:6)

a = 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 

--&gt; reshape(a,2,3)

ans = 
 1 3 5 
 2 4 6 
</PRE>
<P>
The second example reshapes a longer row vector into a volume with 
two planes.
<PRE>
--&gt; a = uint8(1:12)

a = 
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 

--&gt; reshape(a,[2,3,2])

ans = 

(:,:,1) = 
  1  3  5 
  2  4  6 

(:,:,2) = 
  7  9 11 
  8 10 12 
</PRE>
<P>
The third example reshapes a matrix into another matrix.
<PRE>
--&gt; a = [1,6,7;3,4,2]

a = 
 1 6 7 
 3 4 2 

--&gt; reshape(a,3,2)

ans = 
 1 4 
 3 7 
 6 2 
</PRE>
