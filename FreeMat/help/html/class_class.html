<H3>Usage</H3>
There are several uses for the <code>class</code> function.  The first
version takes a single argument, and returns the class of
that variable.  The syntax for this form is
<PRE>
  classname = class(variable)
</PRE>
<P>
and it returns a string containing the name of the class for
<code>variable</code>.  The second form of the class function is used
to construct an object of a specific type based on a structure
which contains data elements for the class.  The syntax for
this version is
<PRE>
  classvar = class(template, classname, parent1, parent2,...)
</PRE>
<P>
This should be called inside the constructor for the class.
The resulting class will be of the type <code>classname</code>, and will
be derived from <code>parent1</code>, <code>parent2</code>, etc.  The <code>template</code>
argument should be a structure array that contains the members
of the class.  See the <code>constructors</code> help for some details
on how to use the <code>class</code> function.  Note that if the
<code>template</code> argument is an empty structure matrix, then the
resulting variable has no fields beyond those inherited from
the parent classes.
