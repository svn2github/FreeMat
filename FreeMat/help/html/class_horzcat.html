<H3>Usage</H3>
This is a method for a class that is invoked to concatenate two or more
variables of the same class type together.  Besides being called
when you invoke
<PRE>
   c = horzcat(a,b,c)
</PRE>
<P>
when <code>a</code> is a class, it is also called for 
<PRE>
   c = [a,b,c]
</PRE>
<P>
when one of these variables is a class.  The exact meaning of
horizontal concatenation depends on the class you have designed.
