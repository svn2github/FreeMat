<H3>Usage</H3>
This is a method for a class that is invoked to concatenate two or more
variables of the same class type together.  Besides being called when
you invoke
<PRE>
   c = vertcat(a,b,c)
</PRE>
<P>
when <code>a</code> is a class, it is also called for
<PRE>
   c = [a;b;c]
</PRE>
<P>
when one of the variables is a class.  The exact meaning of 
vertical concatenation depends on the class you have designed.
