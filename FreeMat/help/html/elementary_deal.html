<H3>Usage</H3>
When making a function call, it is possible to assign
multiple outputs in a single call, (see, e.g., <code>max</code> for
an example).  The <code>deal</code> call allows you to do the 
same thing with a simple assignment.  The syntax for its
use is
<PRE>
   [a,b,c,...] = deal(expr)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>expr</code> is an expression with multiple values.  The simplest
example is where <code>expr</code> is the dereference of a cell array, e.g.
<code>expr &lt;-- A{:}</code>.  In this case, the <code>deal</code> call is equivalent
to
<PRE>
   a = A{1}; b = A{2}; C = A{3}; 
</PRE>
<P>
Other expressions which are multivalued are structure arrays with
multiple entries (non-scalar), where field dereferencing has been
applied.
