 Produce difference of successive vector elements.
 
 If <code>x</code> is a vector of length n, <code>diff (x)</code> is the
 vector of first differences
 \[
  [x_2 - x_1, ..., x_n - x_{n-1}].
 \]

 If <code>x</code> is a matrix, <code>diff (x)</code> is the matrix of column
 differences along the first non-singleton dimension.

 The second argument is optional.  If supplied, <code>diff (x,k)</code>,
 where <code>k</code> is a nonnegative integer, returns the
 <code>k</code>-th differences. It is possible that <code>k</code> is larger than
 then first non-singleton dimension of the matrix. In this case,
 <code>diff</code> continues to take the differences along the next
 non-singleton dimension.

 The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly
 stated with the optional variable <code>dim</code>. In this case the 
 <code>k</code>-th order differences are calculated along this dimension.
 In the case where <code>k</code> exceeds <code>size (x, dim)</code>
 then an empty matrix is returned.
