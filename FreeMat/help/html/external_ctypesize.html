<H3>Usage</H3>
The <code>ctypesize</code> function is used to compute the size of a C structure
that is defined using the <code>ctypedefine</code> function.  The usage of 
<code>ctypesize</code> is 
<PRE>
   size = ctypesize('typename')
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>typename</code> is the name of the C structure you want to compute
the size of.  The returned count is measured in bytes.  Note that as
indicated in the help for <code>ctypedefine</code> that FreeMat does not 
automatically pad the entries of the structure to match the particulars
of your C compiler.  Instead, the assumption is that you have adequate
padding entries in your structure to align the FreeMat members with the
C ones.  See <code>ctypedefine</code> for more details.  You can also specify
an optional count parameter if you want to determine how large multiple
structures are
<PRE>
   size = ctypesize('typename',count)
