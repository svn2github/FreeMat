<H3>Usage </H3>
The <code>ctypewrite</code> function is a convenience function for
writing a C typedef to a file.  This is generally a very
bad idea, as writing of C typedefs to files is notoriously
unportable.  Consider yourself warned.  The syntax for this
function is 
<PRE>
  ctypewrite(fid,a,'typename')
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>a</code> is the FreeMat typedef to write, <code>'typename'</code> is
a string containing the name of the C typedef to use when
writing the typedef to the file (previously defined using
<code>ctypedefine</code>), and <code>fid</code> is the file handle returned
by <code>fopen</code>.
