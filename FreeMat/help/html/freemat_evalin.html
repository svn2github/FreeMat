<H3>Usage</H3>
The <code>evalin</code> function is similar to the <code>eval</code> function, with an additional
argument up front that indicates the workspace that the expressions are to 
be evaluated in.  The various syntaxes for <code>evalin</code> are:
<PRE>
   evalin(workspace,expression)
   x = evalin(workspace,expression)
   [x,y,z] = evalin(workspace,expression)
   evalin(workspace,try_clause,catch_clause)
   x = evalin(workspace,try_clause,catch_clause)
   [x,y,z] = evalin(workspace,try_clause,catch_clause)
</PRE>
<P>
The argument <code>workspace</code> must be either 'caller' or 'base'.  If it is
'caller', then the expression is evaluated in the caller's work space.
That does not mean the caller of <code>evalin</code>, but the caller of the current
function or script.  On the other hand if the argument is 'base', then
the expression is evaluated in the base work space.   See <code>eval</code> for
details on the use of each variation.
