<H3>Usage</H3>
The <code>profile</code> function allows you to control the FreeMat profiler.
It has two modes of operation.  The first is to enable-disable
the profiler.  To turn on profiling:
<PRE>
  profiler on
</PRE>
<P>
to turn off profiling, use
<PRE>
  profiler off
</PRE>
<P>
Note that regardless of the state of the profiler, only functions
and scripts are profiled.  Commands entered on the command line
are not profiled.  To see information that has accumulated in a
profile, you use the variant of the command:
<PRE>
  profiler list
</PRE>
<P>
which lists current sorted profiling resuls. You can use this form to obtain 
profiler results as a cell array
<PRE>
  r=profiler('list')
</PRE>
<P>
If you want to see current profile
status issue a <code>profile</code> command with no arguments.
<PRE>
   profiler
