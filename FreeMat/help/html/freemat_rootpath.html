<H3>Usage</H3>
In order to function properly, FreeMat needs to know where to
find the <code>toolbox</code> directory as well as the <code>help</code> directory.
These directories are located on what is known as the <code>root path</code>.
Normally, FreeMat should know where these directories are located.
However under some circumstances (usually when FreeMat is installed
into a non-default location), it may be necessary to indicate
a different root path location, or to specify a particular one.
Note that on the Mac OS platform, FreeMat is installed as a bundle,
and will use the toolbox that is installed in the bundle regardless of
the setting for <code>rootpath</code>.
For Linux, FreeMat will typically use <code>/usr/local/share/FreeMat-&lt;Version&gt;/</code>
for the root path.  Installations from source code will generally work,
but binary installations (e.g., from an <code>RPM</code>) may need to have the
rootpath set.
<P>
The <code>rootpath</code> function has two forms.  The first form takes no arguments
and returns the current root path
<PRE>
   rootpath
</PRE>
<P>
The second form will set a rootpath directly from the command line
<PRE>
   rootpath(path)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>path</code> is the full path to where the <code>toolbox</code> and <code>help</code> 
directories are located.  For example, <code>rootpath('/usr/share/FreeMat-4.0')</code>.
The third form enables the GUI form 
<PRE>
   rootpath gui
</PRE>
<P>
which activates a dialog box to pick a directory that is the root directory
of the FreeMat installation (e.g., where <code>help</code> and <code>toolbox</code> are located.
Changes to <code>rootpath</code> are persistent (you do not need to run it every
time you start FreeMat).
