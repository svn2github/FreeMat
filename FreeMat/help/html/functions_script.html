<H3>Usage</H3>
A script is a sequence of FreeMat commands contained in a
<code>.m</code> file.  When the script is called (via the name of the
file), the effect is the same as if the commands inside the
script file were issued one at a time from the keyboard.
Unlike <code>function</code> files (which have the same extension,
but have a <code>function</code> declaration), script files share
the same environment as their callers.  Hence, assignments,
etc, made inside a script are visible to the caller (which
is not the case for functions.
<H3>Example</H3>
Here is an example of a script that makes some simple 
assignments and <code>printf</code> statements.
<P>
<PRE>
     tscript.m
a = 13;
printf('a is %d\n',a);
b = a + 32

</PRE>
<P>
If we execute the script and then look at the defined variables
<PRE>
--&gt; tscript
a is 13

b = 
 45

  Variable Name       Type   Flags             Size
              a    double                    [1x1]
            ans    double                    [0x0]
              b    double                    [1x1]
</PRE>
we see that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are defined appropriately.
