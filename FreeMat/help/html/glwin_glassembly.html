<H2>GLASSEMBLY Create a GL Assembly
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_glwin.html> OpenGL Models </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Define a GL Assembly.  A GL Assembly consists of one or more
GL Nodes or GL Assemblies that are placed relative to the 
coordinate system of the assembly.  For example, if we have
<code>glnode</code> definitions for <code>'bread'</code> and <code>'cheese'</code>, then
a <code>glassembly</code> of sandwich would consist of placements of
two <code>'bread'</code> nodes with a <code>'cheese'</code> node in between.
Furthermore, a <code>'lunch'</code> assembly could consist of a <code>'sandwich'</code>
a <code>'chips'</code> and <code>'soda'</code>.  Hopefully, you get the idea.  The
syntax for the <code>glassembly</code> command is
<PRE>
   glassembly(name,part1,transform1,part2,transform2,...)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>part1</code> is the name of the first part, and could be
either a <code>glnode</code> or itself be another <code>glassembly</code>.  
Here <code>transform1</code> is the <code>4 x 4 matrix</code> that transforms
the part into the local reference coordinate system.
<P>
WARNING!! Currently FreeMat does not detect or gracefully handle 
self-referential assemblies (i.e, if you try to make a <code>sandwich</code> 
contain a <code>sandwich</code>, which you can do by devious methods that I 
refuse to explain).  Do not do this!  You have been warned.
