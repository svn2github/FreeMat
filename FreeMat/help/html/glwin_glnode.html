<H3>Usage</H3>
Define a GL Node.  A GL Node is an object that can be displayed
in a GL Window.  It is defined by a triangular mesh of vertices.
It must also have a material that defines its appearance (i.e.
color, shininess, etc.).  The syntax for the <code>glnode</code> command
is 
<PRE>
  glnode(name,material,pointset)  
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>material</code> is the name of a material that has already been
defined with <code>gldefmaterial</code>, <code>pointset</code> is a <code>3 x N</code> matrix
of points that define the geometry of the object.  Note that the points
are assumed to be connected in triangular facts, with the points
defined counter clock-wise as seen from the outside of the facet.
<code>FreeMat</code> will compute the normals.  The <code>name</code> argument must
be unique.  If you want multiple instances of a given <code>glnode</code>
in your GLWindow, that is fine, as instances of a <code>glnode</code> are
created through a <code>glassembly</code>.
