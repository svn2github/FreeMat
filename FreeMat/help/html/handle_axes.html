<H3>Usage</H3>
This function has three different syntaxes.  The first takes
no arguments,
<PRE>
  h = axes
</PRE>
<P>
and creates a new set of axes that are parented to the current
figure (see <code>gcf</code>).  The newly created axes are made the current
axes (see <code>gca</code>) and are added to the end of the list of children 
for the current figure.
The second form takes a set of property names and values
<PRE>
  h = axes(propertyname,value,propertyname,value,...)
</PRE>
<P>
Creates a new set of axes, and then sets the specified properties
to the given value.  This is a shortcut for calling 
<code>set(h,propertyname,value)</code> for each pair.
The third form takes a handle as an argument
<PRE>
  axes(handle)
</PRE>
<P>
and makes <code>handle</code> the current axes, placing it at the head of
the list of children for the current figure.
