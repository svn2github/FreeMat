<H3>Usage</H3>
Closes a figure window, either the currently active window, a 
window with a specific handle, or all figure windows.  The general
syntax for its use is
<PRE>
   close(handle)
</PRE>
<P>
in which case the figure window with the speicified <code>handle</code> is
closed.  Alternately, issuing the command with no argument
<PRE>
   close
</PRE>
<P>
is equivalent to closing the currently active figure window.  Finally
the command
<PRE>
   close('all')
</PRE>
<P>
closes all figure windows currently open.
