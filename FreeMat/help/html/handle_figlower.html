<H3>Usage</H3>
Lowers a figure window indicated by the figure number.  The syntax for
its use is
<PRE>
  figlower(fignum)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>fignum</code> is the number of the figure to lower.  The figure will
be lowerd to the bottom of the GUI stack (meaning that it we be behind other
windows).  Note that this function does not cause <code>fignum</code> to 
become the current  figure, you must use the <code>figure</code> command for that.
Similarly, if <code>fignum</code> is the current figure, it will remain the current
figure (even though the figure is now behind others).
