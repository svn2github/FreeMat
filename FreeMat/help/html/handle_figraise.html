<H3>Usage</H3>
Raises a figure window indicated by the figure number.  The syntax for
its use is
<PRE>
  figraise(fignum)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>fignum</code> is the number of the figure to raise.  The figure will
be raised to the top of the GUI stack (meaning that it we be visible).
Note that this function does not cause <code>fignum</code> to become the current
figure, you must use the <code>figure</code> command for that.
