<P>
 Produce histogram counts or plots.
<P>
 With one vector input argument, plot a histogram of the values with
 10 bins.  The range of the histogram bins is determined by the range
 of the data.
<P>
 Given a second scalar argument, use that as the number of bins.
<P>
 Given a second vector argument, use that as the centers of the bins,
 with the width of the bins determined from the adjacent values in
 the vector.
<P>
 If third argument is provided, the histogram is normalised such that
 the sum of the bars is equal to <code>norm</code>.
<P>
 Extreme values are lumped in the first and last bins.
