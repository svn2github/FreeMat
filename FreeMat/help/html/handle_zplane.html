<H3>Usage</H3>
 This function makes a zero-pole plot of a discrete-time
 system defined by its zeros and poles. The various syntaxes
 are
<PRE>
    zplane(z,p)
</PRE>
<P>
 where <code>z</code> and <code>p</code> are the zeros and the poles of the system
 stored as column vectors, or
<PRE>
    zplane(b,a)
</PRE>
<P>
 where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the polynomial coefficients of the
 numerator and denominator stored as line vectors (<code>roots</code> is
 used to find the zeros and poles). The symbol <code>'o'</code> represents
 a zero and the symbol <code>'x'</code> represents a pole. The plot includes
 the unit circle for reference.
