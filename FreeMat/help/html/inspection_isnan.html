<H2>ISNAN Test for Not-a-Numbers
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_inspection.html> Inspection Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Returns true for entries of an array that are NaN's (i.e.,
Not-a-Numbers).  The usage is
<PRE>
   y = isnan(x)
</PRE>
<P>
The result is a logical array of the same size as <code>x</code>,
which is true if <code>x</code> is not-a-number, and false otherwise.
Note that for complex data types that
the result is true if either the real or imaginary parts
are NaNs.
<H3>Example</H3>
Suppose we have an array of floats with one element that
is <code>nan</code>:
<PRE>
--&gt; a = [1.2 3.4 nan 5]

a = 
    1.2000    3.4000 NaN    5.0000 

--&gt; isnan(a)

ans = 
 0 0 1 0 
</PRE>
