<H3>Usage</H3>
Reports information on either all variables in the current context
or on a specified set of variables.  For each variable, the <code>who</code>
function indicates the size and type of the variable as well as 
if it is a global or persistent.  There are two formats for the 
function call.  The first is the explicit form, in which a list
of variables are provided:
<PRE>
  who a1 a2 ...
</PRE>
<P>
In the second form
<PRE>
  who
</PRE>
<P>
the <code>who</code> function lists all variables defined in the current 
context (as well as global and persistent variables). Note that
there are two alternate forms for calling the <code>who</code> function:
<PRE>
  who 'a1' 'a2' ...
</PRE>
<P>
and
<PRE>
  who('a1','a2',...)
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Example</H3>
Here is an example of the general use of <code>who</code>, which lists all of the variables defined.
<PRE>
--&gt; c = [1,2,3];
--&gt; f = 'hello';
--&gt; p = randn(1,256);
--&gt; who
  Variable Name       Type   Flags             Size
              c    double                    [1x3]
              f      char                    [1x5]
              p    double                    [1x256]
</PRE>
In the second case, we examine only a specific variable:
<PRE>
--&gt; who c
  Variable Name       Type   Flags             Size
              c    double                    [1x3]
--&gt; who('c')
  Variable Name       Type   Flags             Size
              c    double                    [1x3]
</PRE>
