Reports information on either all variables in the current context
or on a specified set of variables.  For each variable, the <code>who</code>
function indicates the size and type of the variable as well as 
if it is a global or persistent.  There are two formats for the 
function call.  The first is the explicit form, in which a list
of variables are provided:
<PRE>
  whos a1 a2 ...
</PRE>
<P>
In the second form
<PRE>
  whos
</PRE>
<P>
the <code>whos</code> function lists all variables defined in the current 
context (as well as global and persistent variables). Note that
there are two alternate forms for calling the <code>whos</code> function:
<PRE>
  whos 'a1' 'a2' ...
</PRE>
<P>
and
<PRE>
  whos('a1','a2',...)
</PRE>
