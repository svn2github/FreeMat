Section: <A HREF=sec_io.html> Input/Ouput Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
The <code>csvread</code> function reads a text file containing comma
separated values (CSV), and returns the resulting numeric
matrix (2D).  The function supports multiple syntaxes.  The
first syntax for <code>csvread</code> is 
<PRE>
   x = csvread('filename')
</PRE>
<P>
which attempts to read the entire CSV file into array <code>x</code>.
The file can contain only numeric values.  Each entry in the
file should be separated from other entries by a comma.  However,
FreeMat will attempt to make sense of the entries if the comma
is missing (e.g., a space separated file will also parse correctly).
For complex values, you must be careful with the spaces).  The second
form of <code>csvread</code> allows you to specify the first row and column 
(zero-based index)
<PRE>
  x = csvread('filename',firstrow,firstcol)
</PRE>
<P>
The last form allows you to specify the range to read also.  This form
is
<PRE>
  x = csvread('filename',firstrow,firstcol,readrange)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>readrange</code> is either a 4-vector of the form <code>[R1,C1,R2,C2]</code>,
where <code>R1,C1</code> is the first row and column to use, and <code>R2,C2</code> is the
last row and column to use.  You can also specify the <code>readrange</code> as
a spreadsheet range <code>B12..C34</code>, in which case the index for the
range is 1-based (as in a typical spreadsheet), so that <code>A1</code> is the
first cell in the upper left corner. Note also that <code>csvread</code> is
somewhat limited. 
<H3>Example</H3>
Here is an example of a CSV file that we wish to read in
<P>
<PRE>
     sample_data.csv
10, 12, 13, 00, 45, 16
09, 11, 52, 93, 05, 06
01, 03, 04, 04, 90, -3
14, 17, 13, 67, 30, 43
21, 33, 14, 44, 01, 00

</PRE>
<P>
We start by reading the entire file
<PRE>
--&gt; csvread('sample_data.csv')

ans = 
 10 12 13  0 45 16 
  9 11 52 93  5  6 
  1  3  4  4 90 -3 
 14 17 13 67 30 43 
 21 33 14 44  1  0 
</PRE>
Next, we read everything starting with the second row, and third column
<PRE>
--&gt; csvread('sample_data.csv',1,2)

ans = 
 52 93  5  6 
  4  4 90 -3 
 13 67 30 43 
 14 44  1  0 
</PRE>
Finally, we specify that we only want the <code>3 x 3</code> submatrix starting
with the second row, and third column
<PRE>
--&gt; csvread('sample_data.csv',1,2,[1,2,3,4])

ans = 
 52 93  5 
  4  4 90 
 13 67 30 
</PRE>
