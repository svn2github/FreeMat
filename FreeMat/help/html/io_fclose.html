Section: <A HREF=sec_io.html> Input/Ouput Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Closes a file handle, or all open file handles.  The general syntax
for its use is either
<PRE>
  fclose(handle)
</PRE>
<P>
or
<PRE>
  fclose('all')
</PRE>
<P>
In the first case a specific file is closed,  In the second, all open
files are closed.  Note that until a file is closed the file buffers
are not flushed.  Returns a '0' if the close was successful and a '-1' if
the close failed for some reason.

<PRE>
--&gt; fp = fopen('test.dat','wb','ieee-le')

fp =
