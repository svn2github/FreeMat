<H3>Usage</H3>
Closes a file handle, or all open file handles.  The general syntax
for its use is either

or
<PRE>
  fclose('all')
</PRE>

In the first case a specific file is closed,  In the second, all open
files are closed.  Note that until a file is closed the file buffers
are not flushed.  Returns a '0' if the close was successful and a '-1' if
the close failed for some reason.
