<H3>Usage</H3>
Given a filename, reads an HTML document, (attempts to) parse it, and
returns the result as a FreeMat data structure.  The syntax for its
use is:
<PRE>
   p = htmlread(filename)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>filename</code> is a <code>string</code>.  The
resulting object <code>p</code> is a data structure containing the information
in the document.  Note that this function works by internally converting
the HTML document into something closer to XHTML, and then using the
XML parser to parse it.  In some cases, the converted HTML cannot be properly
parsed.  In such cases, a third party tool such as "tidy" will probably do
a better job.
