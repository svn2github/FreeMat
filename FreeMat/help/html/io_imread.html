Section: <A HREF=sec_io.html> Input/Ouput Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Reads the image data from the given file into a matrix.  Note that
FreeMat's support for <code>imread</code> is not complete.  Only some of the
formats specified in the MATLAB API are implemented.  The syntax
for its use is
<PRE>
  [A,map,alpha] = imread(filename)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>filename</code> is the name of the file to read from.  The returned
arrays <code>A</code> contain the image data, <code>map</code> contains the colormap information
(for indexed images), and <code>alpha</code> contains the alphamap (transparency).
The returned values will depend on the type of the original image.  Generally
you can read images in the <code>jpg,png,xpm,ppm</code> and some other formats.
