<H2>LOAD Load Variables From A File
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_io.html> Input/Ouput Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Loads a set of variables from a file in a machine independent format.
The <code>load</code> function takes one argument:
<PRE>
  load filename,
</PRE>
<P>
or alternately,
<PRE>
  load('filename')
</PRE>
<P>
This command is the companion to <code>save</code>.  It loads the contents of the
file generated by <code>save</code> back into the current context.  Global and 
persistent variables are also loaded and flagged appropriately.  By
default, FreeMat assumes that files that end in a <code>.mat</code> or <code>.MAT</code>
extension are MATLAB-formatted files.  Also, FreeMat assumes that 
files that end in <code>.txt</code> or <code>.TXT</code> are ASCII files. 
For other filenames, FreeMat first tries to open the file as a 
FreeMat binary format file (as created by the <code>save</code> function).  
If the file fails to open as a FreeMat binary file, then FreeMat 
attempts to read it as an ASCII file.  
<P>
You can force FreeMat to assume a particular format for the file
by using alternate forms of the <code>load</code> command.  In particular,
<PRE>
  load -ascii filename
</PRE>
<P>
will load the data in file <code>filename</code> as an ASCII file (space delimited
numeric text) loaded into a single variable in the current workspace
with the name <code>filename</code> (without the extension).
<P>
For MATLAB-formatted data files, you can use
<PRE>
  load -mat filename
</PRE>
<P>
which forces FreeMat to assume that <code>filename</code> is a MAT-file, regardless
of the extension on the filename.
<P>
You can also specify which variables to load from a file (not from 
an ASCII file - only single 2-D variables can be successfully saved and
retrieved from ASCII files) using the additional syntaxes of the <code>load</code>
command.  In particular, you can specify a set of variables to load by name
<PRE>
  load filename Var_1 Var_2 Var_3 ...
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>Var_n</code> is the name of a variable to load from the file.  
Alternately, you can use the regular expression syntax
<PRE>
  load filename -regexp expr_1 expr_2 expr_3 ...
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>expr_n</code> is a regular expression (roughly as expected by <code>regexp</code>).
Note that a simpler regular expression mechanism is used for this syntax
than the full mechanism used by the <code>regexp</code> command.
<P>
Finally, you can use <code>load</code> to create a variable containing the 
contents of the file, instead of automatically inserting the variables
into the curent workspace.  For this form of <code>load</code> you must use the
function syntax, and capture the output:
<PRE>
  V = load('arg1','arg2',...)
</PRE>
<P>
which returns a structure <code>V</code> with one field for each variable
retrieved from the file.  For ASCII files, <code>V</code> is a double precision
matrix.
<P>
<H3>Example</H3>
Here is a simple example of <code>save</code>/<code>load</code>.  First, we save some variables to a file.
<PRE>
--&gt; D = {1,5,'hello'};
--&gt; s = 'test string';
--&gt; x = randn(512,1);
--&gt; z = zeros(512);
--&gt; who
  Variable Name       Type   Flags             Size
              D      cell                    [1x3]
              s      char                    [1x11]
              x    double                    [512x1]
              z    double                    [512x512]
--&gt; save loadsave.dat
</PRE>
Next, we clear the variables, and then load them back from the file.
<PRE>
--&gt; clear D s x z
--&gt; who
  Variable Name       Type   Flags             Size
            ans    double                    [0x0]
--&gt; load loadsave.dat
--&gt; who
  Variable Name       Type   Flags             Size
              D      cell                    [1x3]
            ans    double                    [0x0]
              s      char                    [1x11]
              x    double                    [512x1]
              z    double                    [512x512]
</PRE>
