<H3>Usage</H3>
Converts a string to a number.  The general syntax for its use
is
<PRE>
  x = str2num(string)
</PRE>
<P>
Here <code>string</code> is the data string, which contains the data to 
be converted into a number.  The output is in double precision,
and must be typecasted to the appropriate type based on what
you need.  Note that by definition, <code>str2num</code> is entirely 
equivalent to <code>eval(['[' string ']'],[])</code> with all of the 
associated problems where <code>string</code> contains text that causes
side effects.
