<H3>Usage</H3>
Plays a linear PCM set of samples through the audio system.  This
function is only available if the <code>portaudio</code> library was available
when FreeMat was built.  The syntax for the command is one of:
<PRE>
   wavplay(y)
   wavplay(y,sampling_rate)
   wavplay(...,mode)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>y</code> is a matrix of audio samples.  If <code>y</code> has two columns, then
the audio playback is in stereo.  The <code>y</code> input can be of types 
<code>float, double, int32, int16, int8, uint8</code>.  For <code>float</code> and 
<code>double</code> types, the sample values in <code>y</code> must be between <code>-1</code> and
<code>1</code>.  The <code>sampling_rate</code> specifies the rate at which the data is 
recorded.  If not specified, the <code>sampling_rate</code> defaults to <code>11025Hz</code>.
Finally, you can specify a playback mode of <code>'sync'</code> which is synchronous
playback or a playback mode of <code>'async'</code> which is asynchronous playback.
For <code>'sync'</code> playback, the wavplay function returns when the playback is
complete.  For <code>'async'</code> playback, the function returns immediately (unless
a former playback is still issuing).
