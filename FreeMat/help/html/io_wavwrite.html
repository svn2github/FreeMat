<H3>Usage</H3>
The <code>wavwrite</code> funtion writes an audio signal to a linear PCM WAV
file.  The simplest form for its use is
<PRE>
    wavwrite(y,filename)
</PRE>
<P>
which writes the data stored in <code>y</code> to a WAV file with the name
<code>filename</code>.  By default, the output data is assumed to be sampled at a
rate of 8 KHz, and is output using 16 bit integer format.  Each column
of <code>y</code> is written as a separate channel.  The data are clipped to the
range <code>[-1,1]</code> prior to writing them out.  If you want the data to be
written with a different sampling frequency, you can use the following
form of the <code>wavwrite</code> command:
<PRE>
   wavwrite(y,SampleRate,filename)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>SampleRate</code> is in Hz.  Finally, you can specify the number of
bits to use in the output form of the file using the form
<PRE>
   wavwrite(y,SampleRate,NBits,filename)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>NBits</code> is the number of bits to use.  Legal values include
<code>8,16,24,32</code>.  For less than 32 bit output format, the data is
truncated to the range <code>[-1,1]</code>, and an integer output format is used
(type 1 PCM in WAV-speak).  For 32 bit output format, the data is
written in type 3 PCM as floating point data.
