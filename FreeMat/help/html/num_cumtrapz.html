 The cumtrapz routine has the following syntax
 @[
      [z] = cumtrapz(x,y)
 @]
 where |x| is a dependent vector and |y| an m-by-n matrix equal in
  at least one dimension to x. (e.g.:x = time samples, y = f(t))
 
 Alternatively, you can enter 
<PRE>
      [z] = cumtrapz(y) 
</PRE>
<P>
 for a unit integration of |y|. 

 If |y| is a matrix, m must be equal to length(x) (e.g.:
 y must have the same number of rows as x has elements).
 In this case, integrals are taken for each row, returned in a
 resulting vector z of dimension (1,n)
