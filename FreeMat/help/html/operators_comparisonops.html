<H2>COMPARISONOPS Array Comparison Operators

<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_operators.html> Mathematical Operators </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
There are a total of six comparison operators available in FreeMat, all of which are binary operators with the following syntax
<PRE>
  y = a &lt; b
  y = a &lt;= b
  y = a &gt; b
  y = a &gt;= b
  y = a ~= b
  y = a == b
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are numerical arrays or scalars, and <code>y</code> is a <code>logical</code> array of the appropriate size.  Each of the operators has three modes of operation, summarized in the following list:
<OL>
<LI>  <code>a</code> is a scalar, <code>b</code> is an n-dimensional array - the output is then the same size as <code>b</code>, and contains the result of comparing each element in <code>b</code> to the scalar <code>a</code>.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>a</code> is an n-dimensional array, <code>b</code> is a scalar - the output is the same size as <code>a</code>, and contains the result of comparing each element in <code>a</code> to the scalar <code>b</code>.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both n-dimensional arrays of the same size - the output is then the same size as both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and contains the result of an element-wise comparison between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
 </LI>
</OL>
The operators behave the same way as in <code>C</code>, with unequal types being promoted using the standard type promotion rules prior to comparisons.  The only difference is that in FreeMat, the not-equals operator is <code>~=</code> instead of <code>!=</code>.
<H3>Examples</H3>
Some simple examples of comparison operations.  First a comparison with a scalar:
<PRE>
--&gt; a = randn(1,5)

a = 
   -0.1760    0.0212    0.0095    2.0556   -1.1627 

--&gt; a&gt;0

ans = 
 0 1 1 1 0 
</PRE>
<P>
Next, we construct two vectors, and test for equality:
<PRE>
--&gt; a = [1,2,5,7,3]

a = 
 1 2 5 7 3 

--&gt; b = [2,2,5,9,4]

b = 
 2 2 5 9 4 

--&gt; c = a == b

c = 
 0 1 1 0 0 
</PRE>
