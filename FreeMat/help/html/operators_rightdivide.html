<H2>RIGHTDIVIDE Matrix Equation Solver/Divide Operator
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_operators.html> Mathematical Operators </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
The divide operator <code>/</code> is really a combination of three
operators, all of which have the same general syntax:
<PRE>
  Y = A / B
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are arrays of numerical type.  The result <code>Y</code> depends
on which of the following three situations applies to the arguments
<code>A</code> and <code>B</code>:
<OL>
<LI>  <code>A</code> is a scalar, <code>B</code> is an arbitrary <code>n</code>-dimensional numerical array, in which case the output is the scalar <code>A</code> divided into each element of <code>B</code>.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>B</code> is a scalar, <code>A</code> is an arbitrary <code>n</code>-dimensional numerical array, in which case the output is each element of <code>A</code> divided by the scalar <code>B</code>.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>A,B</code> are matrices with the same number of columns, i.e., <code>A</code> is of size <code>K x M</code>, and <code>B</code> is of size <code>L x M</code>, in which case the output is of size <code>K x L</code>.
 </LI>
</OL>
The output follows the standard type promotion rules, although in the first two cases, if <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are integers, the output is an integer also, while in the third case if <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are integers, the output is of type <code>double</code>.

<H3>Function Internals</H3>
There are three formulae for the times operator.  For the first form

and the second form

<P>
In the third form, the output is defined as:
<P>

</DIV>
<P>
and is used in the equation <code>Y B = A</code>.
<H3>Examples</H3>
The right-divide operator is much less frequently used than the left-divide operator, but the concepts are similar.  It can be used to find least-squares and minimum norm solutions.  It can also be used to solve systems of equations in much the same way.  Here's a simple example:
<PRE>
--&gt; B = [1,1;0,1];
--&gt; A = [4,5]

A = 
 4 5 

--&gt; A/B

ans = 
 4 1
