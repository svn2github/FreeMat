Starting with FreeMat 4.0, the type of <code>y</code> is determined according to the
same rules as Matlab.  These are the rules:
<OL>
<LI>  Integer types of the same class can be combined.  The answer is
the same type as the inputs, and the operation is performed using 
saturating arithmetic.  Integer types can also be combined with double
precision values (again, the result is of the integer type).
 </LI>
<LI>  Single precision floating point values can be combined with double
precision, logical and character array classes.  The result is of 
class single.
 </LI>
<LI>  Double precision floating point values can be combined with all
other types.  Except as noted above, the output is of double precision.
 </LI>
</OL>
These rules look strange, and they are.   In general, computations are
done in double precision in almost all cases.  When single precision
values are involved, the computations take place in single precision.
