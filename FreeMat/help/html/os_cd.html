<H2>CD Change Working Directory Function

<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_os.html> Operating System Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Changes the current working directory to the one specified as the argument.  The general syntax for its use is
<PRE>
  cd('dirname')
</PRE>
<P>
but this can also be expressed as
<PRE>
  cd 'dirname'
</PRE>
<P>
or 
<PRE>
  cd dirname
</PRE>
<P>
Examples of all three usages are given below.
Generally speaking, <code>dirname</code> is any string that would be accepted 
by the underlying OS as a valid directory name.  For example, on most 
systems, <code>'.'</code> refers to the current directory, and <code>'..'</code> refers 
to the parent directory.  Also, depending on the OS, it may be necessary 
to ``escape'' the directory seperators.  In particular, if directories 
are seperated with the backwards-slash character <code>'\\'</code>, then the 
path specification must use double-slashes <code>'\\\\'</code>. Note: to get 
file-name completion to work at this time, you must use one of the 
first two forms of the command.
<P>
<H3>Example</H3>
The <code>pwd</code> command returns the current directory location.  First, 
we use the simplest form of the <code>cd</code> command, in which the directory 
name argument is given unquoted.
<PRE>
--&gt; pwd

ans = 
/home/sbasu/Devel/FreeMat/help/tmp
--&gt; cd ..
--&gt; pwd

ans = 
/home/sbasu/Devel/FreeMat/help
</PRE>
Next, we use the ``traditional'' form of the function call, using 
both the parenthesis and a variable to store the quoted string.
<PRE>
--&gt; a = pwd;
--&gt; cd(a)
--&gt; pwd

ans = 
/home/sbasu/Devel/FreeMat/help/tmp
</PRE>
