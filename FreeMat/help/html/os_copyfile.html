<H3>Usage</H3>
Copies a file or files from one location to another.  There are 
several syntaxes for this function that are acceptable:
<PRE>
   copyfile(file_in,file_out)
</PRE>
<P>
copies the file from <code>file_in</code> to <code>file_out</code>.  Also, the second
argument can be a directory name:
<PRE>
   copyfile(file_in,directory_out)
</PRE>
<P>
in which case <code>file_in</code> is copied into the directory specified by
<code>directory_out</code>.  You can also use <code>copyfile</code> to copy entire directories
as in
<PRE>
   copyfile(dir_in,dir_out)
</PRE>
<P>
in which case the directory contents are copied to the destination directory
(which is created if necessary).  Finally, the first argument to <code>copyfile</code> can
contain wildcards
<PRE>
   copyfile(pattern,directory_out)
</PRE>
<P>
in which case all files that match the given pattern are copied to the output
directory.   Note that to remain compatible with the MATLAB API, this function
will delete/replace destination files that already exist, unless they are marked
as read-only.  If you want to force the copy to succeed, you can append a <code>'f'</code>
argument to the <code>copyfile</code> function:
<PRE>
   copyfile(arg1,arg2,'f')
</PRE>
<P>
or equivalently
<PRE>
   copyfile arg1 arg2 f
</PRE>
