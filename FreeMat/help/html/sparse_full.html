<H2>FULL Convert Sparse Matrix to Full Matrix
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_sparse.html> Sparse Matrix Support </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Converts a sparse matrix to a full matrix.  The syntax for
its use is
<PRE>
   y = full(x)
</PRE>
<P>
The type of <code>x</code> is preserved.  Be careful with the function.
As a general rule of thumb, if you can work with the <code>full</code>
representation of a function, you probably do not need the
sparse representation.
<H3>Example</H3>
Here we convert a full matrix to a sparse one, and back again.
<PRE>
--&gt; a = [1,0,4,2,0;0,0,0,0,0;0,1,0,0,2]

a = 
 1 0 4 2 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 
 0 1 0 0 2 

--&gt; A = sparse(a)

A = 
 1 1 1
 3 2 1
 1 3 4
 1 4 2
 3 5 2
--&gt; full(A)

ans = 
 1 0 4 2 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 
 0 1 0 0 2
