<H2>THREADID Get Current Thread Handle
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_thread.html> FreeMat Threads </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
The <code>threadid</code> function in FreeMat tells you which thread
is executing the context you are in.  Normally, this is thread
1, the main thread.  However, if you start a new thread using
<code>threadnew</code>, you will be operating in a new thread, and functions
that call <code>threadid</code> from the new thread will return their 
handles.
<H3>Example</H3>
From the main thread, we have
<PRE>
--&gt; threadid

ans = 
 2 
</PRE>
But from a launched auxilliary thread, we have
<PRE>
--&gt; t_id = threadnew

t_id = 
 3 

--&gt; id = threadcall(t_id,1000,'threadid')

id = 
 3 

--&gt; threadfree(t_id);
</PRE>
