<H2>THREADWAIT Wait on a thread to complete execution
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_thread.html> FreeMat Threads </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
The <code>threadwait</code> function waits for the given thread to complete
execution, and stops execution of the current thread (the one calling
<code>threadwait</code>) until the given thread completes.  The syntax for its
use is 
<PRE>
   success = threadwait(handle)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>handle</code> is the value returned by <code>threadnew</code> and <code>success</code>
is a <code>logical</code> vaariable that will be <code>1</code> if the wait was successful
or <code>0</code> if the wait times out.  By default, the wait is indefinite.  It
is better to use the following form of the function
<PRE>
   success = threadwait(handle,timeout)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>timeout</code> is the amount of time (in milliseconds) for 
the <code>threadwait</code> function to wait before a timeout occurs.  
If the <code>threadwait</code> function succeeds, then the return 
value is a logical <code>1</code>, and if it fails, the return value 
is a logical <code>0</code>.  Note that you can call <code>threadwait</code> multiple
times on a thread, and if the thread is completed, each one
will succeed.
<H3>Example</H3>
Here we lauch the <code>sleep</code> function in a thread with a time delay of 
10 seconds.  This means that the thread function will not complete
until 10 seconds have elapsed.  When we call <code>threadwait</code> on this
thread with a short timeout, it fails, but not when the timeout
is long enough to capture the end of the function call.
<PRE>
--&gt; a = threadnew;
--&gt; threadstart(a,'sleep',0,10);  % start a thread that will sleep for 10
--&gt; threadwait(a,2000)            % 2 second wait is not long enough

ans = 
 0 

--&gt; threadwait(a,10000)           % 10 second wait is long enough

ans = 
 1 

--&gt; threadfree(a)
