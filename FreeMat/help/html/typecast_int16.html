<H2>INT16 Convert to Signed 16-bit Integer
</H2>
<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_typecast.html> Type Conversion Functions </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
Converts the argument to an signed 16-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is
<PRE>
   y = int16(x)
</PRE>
<P>
where <code>x</code> is an <code>n</code>-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows the saturation rules (e.g., if <code>x</code> is outside the normal
range for a signed 16-bit integer of <code>[-32767,32767]</code>, it is truncated
to that range).  Note that both <code>NaN</code> and <code>Inf</code> both map to 0.
<H3>Example</H3>
The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of <code>int16</code>.  First, the routine uses
<PRE>
--&gt; int16(100)

ans = 
 100 

--&gt; int16(-100)

ans = 
 -100 
</PRE>
In the next example, an integer outside the range  of the type is passed in.  
The result is truncated to the range of the data type.
<PRE>
--&gt; int16(40000)

ans = 
 32767 
</PRE>
In the next example, a positive double precision argument is passed in.  
The result is the signed integer that is closest to the argument.
<PRE>
--&gt; int16(pi)

ans = 
 3 
</PRE>
In the next example, a complex argument is passed in.  The result is the 
signed complex integer that is closest to the argument.
<PRE>
--&gt; int16(5+2*i)

ans = 
   5.0000 +  2.0000i 
</PRE>
In the next example, a string argument is passed in.  The string argument is 
converted into an integer array corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.
<PRE>
--&gt; int16('helo')

ans = 
 104 101 108 111 
</PRE>
In the last example, a cell-array is passed in.  For cell-arrays and 
structure arrays, the result is an error.
<PRE>
--&gt; int16({4})
Error: Cannot perform type conversions with this type
</PRE>
