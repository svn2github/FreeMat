<H3>Usage</H3>
The cell array is a fairly powerful array type that is available
in FreeMat.  Generally speaking, a cell array is a heterogenous
array type, meaning that different elements in the array can 
contain variables of different type (including other cell arrays).
For those of you familiar with <code>C</code>, it is the equivalent to the
<code>void *</code> array.  The general syntax for their construction is
<PRE>
   A = {row_def1;row_def2;...;row_defN}
</PRE>
<P>
where each row consists of one or more elements, seperated by
commas
<PRE>
  row_defi = element_i1,element_i2,...,element_iM
</PRE>
<P>
Each element can be any type of FreeMat variable, including
matrices, arrays, cell-arrays, structures, strings, etc.  The
restriction on the definition is that each row must have the
same number of elements in it.
<H3>Examples</H3>
Here is an example of a cell-array that contains a number,
a string, and an array
<PRE>
--&gt; A = {14,'hello',[1:10]}

A = 
 [14] [hello] [1x10 double array] 
</PRE>
Note that in the output, the number and string are explicitly
printed, but the array is summarized.
We can create a 2-dimensional cell-array by adding another
row definition
<PRE>
--&gt; B = {pi,i;e,-1}

B = 
 [3.14159] [0+1i] 
 [2.71828] [-1] 
</PRE>
Finally, we create a new cell array by placing <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>
together
<PRE>
--&gt; C = {A,B}

C = 
 [1x3 cell array] [2x2 cell array] 
</PRE>
