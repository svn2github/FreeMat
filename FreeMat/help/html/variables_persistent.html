<H3>Usage</H3>
Persistent variables are variables whose value persists between
calls to a function or script.  The general syntax for its
use is
<PRE>
   persistent variable1 variable2 ... variableN
</PRE>
<P>
The <code>persistent</code> statement must occur before the variable
is the tagged as persistent.  Per the MATLAB API documentation
an empty variable is created when the <code>persistent</code> statement
is called.
<H3>Example</H3>
Here is an example of a function that counts how many
times it has been called.
<P>
<PRE>
     count_calls.m
function count_calls
  persistent ccount
  if (~exist('ccount')) ccount = 0; end;
  ccount = ccount + 1;
  printf('Function has been called %d times\n',ccount);

</PRE>
<P>
We now call the function several times:
<PRE>
--&gt; for i=1:10; count_calls; end
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
Function has been called 0 times
