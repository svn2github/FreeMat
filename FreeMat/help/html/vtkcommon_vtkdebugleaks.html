<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkDebugLeaks is used to report memory leaks at the exit of the program.
 It uses the vtkObjectFactory to intercept the construction of all VTK
 objects. It uses the UnRegister method of vtkObject to intercept the
 destruction of all objects. A table of object name to number of instances
 is kept. At the exit of the program if there are still VTK objects around
 it will print them out.  To enable this class add the flag
 -DVTK_DEBUG_LEAKS to the compile line, and rebuild vtkObject and
 vtkObjectFactory.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkDebugLeaks, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkDebugLeaks
</PRE>
