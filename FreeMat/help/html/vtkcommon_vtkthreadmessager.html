In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkThreadMessager class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkThreadMessager = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkThreadMessager = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.WaitForMessage ()</code> -  Wait (block, non-busy) until another thread sends a
 message.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SendWakeMessage ()</code> -  Send a message to all threads who are waiting via
 WaitForMessage().
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.EnableWaitForReceiver ()</code> -  pthreads only. If the wait is enabled, the thread who
 is to call WaitForMessage() will block until a receiver
 thread is ready to receive.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.DisableWaitForReceiver ()</code> -  pthreads only. If the wait is enabled, the thread who
 is to call WaitForMessage() will block until a receiver
 thread is ready to receive.
 </LI>

 If wait is enable, this will block until one thread is ready
 to receive a message.
 </LI>

 VTK 5.0.
