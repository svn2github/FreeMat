<H3>Usage</H3>
 A vtkTransform can be used to describe the full range of linear (also
 known as affine) coordinate transformations in three dimensions,
 which are internally represented as a 4x4 homogeneous transformation
 matrix.  When you create a new vtkTransform, it is always initialized
 to the identity transformation.
 &lt;P&gt;The SetInput() method allows you to set another transform,
 instead of the identity transform, to be the base transformation.
 There is a pipeline mechanism to ensure that when the input is
 modified, the current transformation will be updated accordingly.
 This pipeline mechanism is also supported by the Concatenate() method.
 &lt;P&gt;Most of the methods for manipulating this transformation,
 e.g. Translate, Rotate, and Concatenate, can operate in either
 PreMultiply (the default) or PostMultiply mode.  In PreMultiply
 mode, the translation, concatenation, etc. will occur before any
 transformations which are represented by the current matrix.  In
 PostMultiply mode, the additional transformation will occur after 
 any transformations represented by the current matrix.
 &lt;P&gt;This class performs all of its operations in a right handed
 coordinate system with right handed rotations. Some other graphics
 libraries use left handed coordinate systems and rotations.

To create an instance of class vtkTransform, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkTransform has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.

 it is experimental.
