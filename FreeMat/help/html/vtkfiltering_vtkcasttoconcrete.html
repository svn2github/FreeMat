<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkCastToConcrete is a filter that works around type-checking limitations
 in the filter classes. Some filters generate abstract types on output, 
 and cannot be connected to the input of filters requiring a concrete
 input type. For example, vtkElevationFilter generates vtkDataSet for output,
 and cannot be connected to vtkDecimate, because vtkDecimate requires 
 vtkPolyData as input. This is true even though (in this example) the input 
 to vtkElevationFilter is of type vtkPolyData, and you know the output of 
 vtkElevationFilter is the same type as its input.
<P>
 vtkCastToConcrete performs run-time checking to insure that output type
 is of the right type. An error message will result if you try to cast
 an input type improperly. Otherwise, the filter performs the appropriate
 cast and returns the data.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkCastToConcrete, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkCastToConcrete
