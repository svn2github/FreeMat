<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkColorTransferFunction is a color mapping in RGB or HSV space that
 uses piecewise hermite functions to allow interpolation that can be
 piecewise constant, piecewise linear, or somewhere in-between 
 (a modified piecewise hermite function that squishes the function
 according to a sharpness parameter). The function also allows for
 the specification of the midpoint (the place where the function
 reaches the average of the two bounding nodes) as a normalize distance
 between nodes.
 See the description of class vtkPiecewiseFunction for an explanation of
 midpoint and sharpness.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkColorTransferFunction, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkColorTransferFunction
