Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkfiltering.html> Visualization Toolkit Filtering Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkDataSetAttributes is a class that is used to represent and manipulate
 attribute data (e.g., scalars, vectors, normals, texture coordinates,
 tensors, global ids, pedigree ids, and field data). 
<P>
 This adds to vtkFieldData the ability to pick one of the arrays from the 
 field as the currently active array for each attribute type. In other 
 words, you pick one array to be called "THE" Scalars, and then filters down 
 the pipeline will treat that array specially. For example vtkContourFilter 
 will contour "THE" Scalar array unless a different array is asked for.
<P>
 Additionally vtkDataSetAttributes provides methods that filters call to 
 pass data through, copy data into, and interpolate from Fields. PassData 
 passes entire arrays from the source to the destination. Copy passes 
 through some subset of the tuples from the source to the destination. 
 Interpolate interpolates from the chosen tuple(s) in the source data, using 
 the provided weights, to produce new tuples in the destination. 
 Each attribute type has pass, copy and interpolate "copy" flags that 
 can be set in the destination to choose which attribute arrays will be
 transfered from the source to the destination. 
 
 Finally this class provides a mechanism to determine which attributes a 
 group of sources have in common, and to copy tuples from a source into 
 the destination, for only those attributes that are held by all.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkDataSetAttributes, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkDataSetAttributes

 1. If the copy/interpolate/pass for an attribute is set (on or off), it is applied.
    This overrides rules 2 and 3.
 2. If the copy flag for an array is set (on or off), it is applied
    This overrides rule 3.
 3. If CopyAllOn is set, copy the array.
    If CopyAllOff is set, do not copy the array

<LI>  <code>obj.PassData (vtkFieldData fd)</code> -  Pass entire arrays of input data through to output. Obey the "copy"
 flags. When passing a field,  the following copying rules are 
 followed: 1) Check if a field is an attribute, if yes and if there
 is a PASSDATA copy flag for that attribute (on or off), obey the flag 
 for that attribute, ignore (2) and (3), 2) if there is a copy field for
 that field (on or off), obey the flag, ignore (3) 3) obey
 CopyAllOn/Off
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.CopyAllocate (vtkDataSetAttributes pd, vtkIdType sze, vtkIdType ext)</code> -  Allocates point data for point-by-point (or cell-by-cell) copy operation.
 If sze=0, then use the input DataSetAttributes to create (i.e., find 
 initial size of) new objects; otherwise use the sze variable.
 Note that pd HAS to be the vtkDataSetAttributes object which
 will later be used with CopyData. If this is not the case,
 consider using the alternative forms of CopyAllocate and CopyData.
 ext is no longer used.
 If shallowCopyArrays is true, input arrays are copied to the output
 instead of new ones being allocated.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.CopyAllocate (vtkDataSetAttributes pd, vtkIdType sze, vtkIdType ext, int shallowCopyArrays)</code> -  Allocates point data for point-by-point (or cell-by-cell) copy operation.

 initial size of) new objects; otherwise use the sze variable.
 Note that pd HAS to be the vtkDataSetAttributes object which

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.CopyStructuredData (vtkDataSetAttributes inDsa, int inExt, int outExt)</code> -  This method is used to copy data arrays in images.
 You should call "CopyAllocate" before calling this method.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.CopyData (vtkDataSetAttributes fromPd, vtkIdType fromId, vtkIdType toId)</code> -  Copy the attribute data from one id to another. Make sure CopyAllocate()
 has been invoked before using this method. When copying a field,  
 the following copying rules are 
 followed: 1) Check if a field is an attribute, if yes and if there
 is a COPYTUPLE copy flag for that attribute (on or off), obey the  flag 
 for that attribute, ignore (2) and (3), 2) if there is a copy field for
 that field (on or off), obey the flag, ignore (3) 3) obey
 CopyAllOn/Off
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.CopyTuple (vtkAbstractArray fromData, vtkAbstractArray toData, vtkIdType fromId, vtkIdType toId)</code> -  Copy a tuple of data from one data array to another. This method
 assumes that the fromData and toData objects are of the
 same type, and have the same number of components. This is true if you
 invoke CopyAllocate() or InterpolateAllocate().
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InterpolateAllocate (vtkDataSetAttributes pd, vtkIdType sze, vtkIdType ext)</code> -  Initialize point interpolation method.
 Note that pd HAS to be the vtkDataSetAttributes object which
 will later be used with InterpolatePoint or InterpolateEdge.
 ext is no longer used.
 If shallowCopyArrays is true, input arrays are copied to the output
 instead of new ones being allocated.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InterpolateAllocate (vtkDataSetAttributes pd, vtkIdType sze, vtkIdType ext, int shallowCopyArrays)</code> -  Initialize point interpolation method.
 Note that pd HAS to be the vtkDataSetAttributes object which
 will later be used with InterpolatePoint or InterpolateEdge.
 ext is no longer used.
 If shallowCopyArrays is true, input arrays are copied to the output
 instead of new ones being allocated.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InterpolatePoint (vtkDataSetAttributes fromPd, vtkIdType toId, vtkIdList ids, double weights)</code> -  Interpolate data set attributes from other data set attributes
 given cell or point ids and associated interpolation weights.
 If the INTERPOLATION copy flag is set to 0 for an array, interpolation
 is prevented. If the flag is set to 1, weighted interpolation occurs.
 If the flag is set to 2, nearest neighbor interpolation is used.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InterpolateEdge (vtkDataSetAttributes fromPd, vtkIdType toId, vtkIdType p1, vtkIdType p2, double t)</code> -  Interpolate data from the two points p1,p2 (forming an edge) and an 
 interpolation factor, t, along the edge. The weight ranges from (0,1), 
 with t=0 located at p1. Make sure that the method InterpolateAllocate() 
 has been invoked before using this method.
 If the INTERPOLATION copy flag is set to 0 for an array, interpolation
 is prevented. If the flag is set to 1, weighted interpolation occurs.
 If the flag is set to 2, nearest neighbor interpolation is used.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InterpolateTime (vtkDataSetAttributes from1, vtkDataSetAttributes from2, vtkIdType id, double t)</code> -  Interpolate data from the same id (point or cell) at different points
 in time (parameter t). Two input data set attributes objects are input.
 The parameter t lies between (0&lt;=t&lt;=1). IMPORTANT: it is assumed that
 the number of attributes and number of components is the same for both
 from1 and from2, and the type of data for from1 and from2 are the same.
 Make sure that the method InterpolateAllocate() has been invoked before 
 using this method.
 If the INTERPOLATION copy flag is set to 0 for an array, interpolation
 is prevented. If the flag is set to 1, weighted interpolation occurs.
 If the flag is set to 2, nearest neighbor interpolation is used.
