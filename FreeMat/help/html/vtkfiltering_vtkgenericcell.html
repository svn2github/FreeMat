<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkGenericCell is a class that provides access to concrete types of cells.
 It's main purpose is to allow thread-safe access to cells, supporting
 the vtkDataSet::GetCell(vtkGenericCell *) method. vtkGenericCell acts
 like any type of cell, it just dereferences an internal representation.
 The SetCellType() methods use \#define constants; these are defined in
 the file vtkCellType.h.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkGenericCell, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkGenericCell
