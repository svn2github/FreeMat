<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkImageData is a data object that is a concrete implementation of
 vtkDataSet. vtkImageData represents a geometric structure that is
 a topological and geometrical regular array of points. Examples include
 volumes (voxel data) and pixmaps.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkImageData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkImageData

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetDimensions (int i, int j, int k)</code> -  Pass your way. This is for backward compatibility only.

 Same as SetExtent(0, i-1, 0, j-1, 0, k-1)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetDimensions (int dims[3])</code> -  Pass your way. This is for backward compatibility only.

 in the cell are specified with pcoords[3]. The function returns a 0 if the
 point x is outside of the volume, and a 1 if inside the volume.

 vectors are arranged corresponds to the ordering of the voxel points.
 Gradient vector is computed by central differences (except on edges of
 volume where forward difference is used). The scalars s are the scalars
 from which the gradient is to be computed. This method will treat

 The dataset extent does not have to start at (0,0,0). (0,0,0) is just the
 extent of the origin.
 The first point (the one with Id=0) is at extent
 (Extent[0],Extent[2],Extent[4]). As for any dataset, a data array on point
 data starts at Id=0.

 data starts at Id=0.
