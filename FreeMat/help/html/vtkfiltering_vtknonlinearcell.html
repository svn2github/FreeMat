<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkNonLinearCell is an abstract superclass for non-linear cell types.
 Cells that are a direct subclass of vtkCell or vtkCell3D are linear;
 cells that are a subclass of vtkNonLinearCell have non-linear interpolation
 functions. Non-linear cells require special treatment when tessellating
 or converting to graphics primitives. Note that the linearity of the cell
 is a function of whether the cell needs tessellation, which does not
 strictly correlate with interpolation order (e.g., vtkHexahedron has
 non-linear interpolation functions (a product of three linear functions
 in r-s-t) even thought vtkHexahedron is considered linear.)
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkNonLinearCell, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkNonLinearCell
