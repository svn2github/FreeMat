<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkParametricSpline is a parametric function for 1D interpolating splines.
 vtkParametricSpline maps the single parameter u into a 3D point (x,y,z)
 using three instances of interpolating splines.  This family of 1D splines
 is quaranteed to be parameterized in the interval [0,1].  Attempting to
 evaluate outside this interval will cause the parameter u to be clamped in
 the range [0,1].
<P>
 When constructed, this class creates instances of vtkCardinalSpline for
 each of the x-y-z coordinates. The user may choose to replace these with
 their own instances of subclasses of vtkSpline.
<P>
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkParametricSpline, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkParametricSpline

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkParametricSpline has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkParametricSpline class.
