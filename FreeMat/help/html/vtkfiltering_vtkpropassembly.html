<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkPropAssembly is an object that groups props and other prop assemblies
 into a tree-like hierarchy. The props can then be treated as a group
 (e.g., turning visibility on and off).
<P>
 A vtkPropAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkProp since it is a
 subclass of vtkProp. The difference is that vtkPropAssembly maintains a
 list of other prop and prop assembly instances (its "parts") that form the
 assembly. Note that this process is recursive: you can create groups 
 consisting of prop assemblies to arbitrary depth.
<P>
 vtkPropAssembly's and vtkProp's that compose a prop assembly need not be
 added to a renderer's list of props, as long as the parent assembly is in
 the prop list. This is because they are automatically renderered during
 the hierarchical traversal process.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkPropAssembly, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkPropAssembly
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkPropAssembly has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkPropAssembly class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkPropAssembly = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkPropAssembly = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.AddPart (vtkProp )</code> -  Add a part to the list of parts.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.RemovePart (vtkProp )</code> -  Remove a part from the list of parts,
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkPropCollection = obj.GetParts ()</code> -  Return the list of parts.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.RenderOpaqueGeometry (vtkViewport ren)</code> -  Render this assembly and all its parts.  The rendering process is
 recursive. The parts of each assembly are rendered only if the
 visibility for the prop is turned on.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.RenderTranslucentPolygonalGeometry (vtkViewport ren)</code> -  Render this assembly and all its parts.  The rendering process is
 recursive. The parts of each assembly are rendered only if the
 visibility for the prop is turned on.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.RenderVolumetricGeometry (vtkViewport ren)</code> -  Render this assembly and all its parts.  The rendering process is
 recursive. The parts of each assembly are rendered only if the
 visibility for the prop is turned on.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.RenderOverlay (vtkViewport ren)</code> -  Render this assembly and all its parts.  The rendering process is
 recursive. The parts of each assembly are rendered only if the
 visibility for the prop is turned on.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.HasTranslucentPolygonalGeometry ()</code> -  Does this prop have some translucent polygonal geometry?
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow )</code> -  Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this actor.
 The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
 resources to release.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetBounds ()</code> -  Get the bounds for this prop assembly as (Xmin,Xmax,Ymin,Ymax,Zmin,Zmax).
 May return NULL in some cases (meaning the bounds is undefined).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ShallowCopy (vtkProp Prop)</code> -  Shallow copy of this vtkPropAssembly.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>long = obj.GetMTime ()</code> -  Override default GetMTime method to also consider all of the
 prop assembly's parts.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InitPathTraversal ()</code> -  Methods to traverse the paths (i.e., leaf nodes) of a prop
 assembly. These methods should be contrasted to those that traverse the
 list of parts using GetParts().  GetParts() returns a list of children
 of this assembly, not necessarily the leaf nodes of the assembly. To use
 the methods below - first invoke InitPathTraversal() followed by
 repeated calls to GetNextPath().  GetNextPath() returns a NULL pointer
 when the list is exhausted. (See the superclass vtkProp for more
 information about paths.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkAssemblyPath = obj.GetNextPath ()</code> -  Methods to traverse the paths (i.e., leaf nodes) of a prop
 assembly. These methods should be contrasted to those that traverse the
 list of parts using GetParts().  GetParts() returns a list of children
 of this assembly, not necessarily the leaf nodes of the assembly. To use
 the methods below - first invoke InitPathTraversal() followed by
 repeated calls to GetNextPath().  GetNextPath() returns a NULL pointer
 when the list is exhausted. (See the superclass vtkProp for more
 information about paths.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetNumberOfPaths ()</code> -  Methods to traverse the paths (i.e., leaf nodes) of a prop
 assembly. These methods should be contrasted to those that traverse the
 list of parts using GetParts().  GetParts() returns a list of children
 of this assembly, not necessarily the leaf nodes of the assembly. To use
 the methods below - first invoke InitPathTraversal() followed by
 repeated calls to GetNextPath().  GetNextPath() returns a NULL pointer
 when the list is exhausted. (See the superclass vtkProp for more
 information about paths.)
