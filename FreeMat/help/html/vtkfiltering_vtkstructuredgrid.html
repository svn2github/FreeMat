<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkStructuredGrid is a data object that is a concrete implementation of
 vtkDataSet. vtkStructuredGrid represents a geometric structure that is a
 topologically regular array of points. The topology is that of a cube that
 has been subdivided into a regular array of smaller cubes. Each point/cell
 can be addressed with i-j-k indices. Examples include finite difference 
 grids.
<P>
 The order and number of points must match that specified by the dimensions
 of the grid. The point order increases in i fastest (from 0&lt;=i&lt;dims[0]),
 then j (0&lt;=j&lt;dims[1]), then k (0&lt;=k&lt;dims[2]) where dims[] are the
 dimensions of the grid in the i-j-k topological directions. The number of
 points is dims[0]*dims[1]*dims[2]. The same is true for the cells of the
 grid. The order and number of cells must match that specified by the
 dimensions of the grid. The cell order increases in i fastest (from
 0&lt;=i&lt;(dims[0]-1)), then j (0&lt;=j&lt;(dims[1]-1)), then k (0&lt;=k&lt;(dims[2]-1))
 The number of cells is (dims[0]-1)*(dims[1]-1)*(dims[2]-1).
 
 A unusual feature of vtkStructuredGrid is the ability to blank, 
 or "turn-off" points and cells in the dataset. This is controlled by 
 defining a "blanking array" whose values (0,1) specify whether
 a point should be blanked or not.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkStructuredGrid, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkStructuredGrid

 0 otherwise.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Crop ()</code> -  Reallocates and copies to set the Extent to the UpdateExtent.
 This is used internally when the exact extent is requested, 
 and the source generated more than the update extent. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.GetPoint (int i, int j, int k, double p[3], bool adjustForExtenttrue)</code> -  Get a point in the grid. If adjustForExtent is true, (i,j,k) is 
 interpreted as a position relative to the beginning of the extent.
 If adjustForExtent is false, (i,j,k) is interpreted literally
 and the (i,j,k) point of the grid is returned regardless of the 
 extent beginning.
 The point coordinate is returned in 'p'.
 The default adjustForExtent is true.
