<H3>Usage</H3>
 This filter can be used to set the blanking in a structured grid with 
 an image. The filter takes two inputs: the structured grid to blank, 
 and the image used to set the blanking. Make sure that the dimensions of
 both the image and the structured grid are identical.
<P>
 Note that the image is interpreted as follows: zero values indicate that
 the structured grid point is blanked; non-zero values indicate that the
 structured grid point is visible. The blanking data must be unsigned char.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkBlankStructuredGridWithImage, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkBlankStructuredGridWithImage
