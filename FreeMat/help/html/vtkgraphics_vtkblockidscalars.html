<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkBlockIdScalars is a filter that generates scalars using the block index
 for each block. Note that all sub-blocks within a block get the same scalar.
 The new scalars array is named \c BlockIdScalars.

To create an instance of class vtkBlockIdScalars, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkBlockIdScalars
