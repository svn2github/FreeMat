<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkCellDerivatives is a filter that computes derivatives of scalars
 and vectors at the center of cells. You can choose to generate
 different output including the scalar gradient (a vector), computed
 tensor vorticity (a vector), gradient of input vectors (a tensor),
 and strain matrix of the input vectors (a tensor); or you may
 choose to pass data through to the output.
<P>
 Note that it is assumed that on input scalars and vector point data
 is available, which are then used to generate cell vectors and tensors.
 (The interpolation functions of the cells are used to compute the
 derivatives which is why point data is required.)
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkCellDerivatives, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkCellDerivatives
