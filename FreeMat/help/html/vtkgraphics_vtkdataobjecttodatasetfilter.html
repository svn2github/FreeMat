<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter is an class that maps a data object (i.e., a field)
 into a concrete dataset, i.e., gives structure to the field by defining a
 geometry and topology.
<P>
 To use this filter you associate components in the input field data with
 portions of the output dataset. (A component is an array of values from
 the field.) For example, you would specify x-y-z points by assigning 
 components from the field for the x, then y, then z values of the points.
 You may also have to specify component ranges (for each z-y-z) to make 
 sure that the number of x, y, and z values is the same. Also, you may 
 want to normalize the components which helps distribute the data 
 uniformly. Once you've setup the filter to combine all the pieces of 
 data into a specified dataset (the geometry, topology, point and cell 
 data attributes), the various output methods (e.g., GetPolyData()) are
 used to retrieve the final product.
<P>
 This filter is often used in conjunction with
 vtkFieldDataToAttributeDataFilter.  vtkFieldDataToAttributeDataFilter
 takes field data and transforms it into attribute data (e.g., point and
 cell data attributes such as scalars and vectors).  To do this, use this
 filter which constructs a concrete dataset and passes the input data
 object field data to its output. and then use
 vtkFieldDataToAttributeDataFilter to generate the attribute data associated
 with the dataset.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

  obj = vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter
