<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkDecimatePro is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a triangle 
 mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry. The input to 
 vtkDecimatePro is a vtkPolyData object, and only triangles are treated. If 
 you desire to decimate polygonal meshes, first triangulate the polygons
 with vtkTriangleFilter object.
 
 The implementation of vtkDecimatePro is similar to the algorithm
 originally described in "Decimation of Triangle Meshes", Proc Siggraph
 `92, with three major differences. First, this algorithm does not
 necessarily preserve the topology of the mesh. Second, it is guaranteed to
 give the a mesh reduction factor specified by the user (as long as certain
 constraints are not set - see Caveats). Third, it is set up generate
 progressive meshes, that is a stream of operations that can be easily
 transmitted and incrementally updated (see Hugues Hoppe's Siggraph '96
 paper on progressive meshes).
 
 The algorithm proceeds as follows. Each vertex in the mesh is classified
 and inserted into a priority queue. The priority is based on the error to
 delete the vertex and retriangulate the hole. Vertices that cannot be
 deleted or triangulated (at this point in the algorithm) are
 skipped. Then, each vertex in the priority queue is processed (i.e.,
 deleted followed by hole triangulation using edge collapse). This
 continues until the priority queue is empty. Next, all remaining vertices
 are processed, and the mesh is split into separate pieces along sharp
 edges or at non-manifold attachment points and reinserted into the
 priority queue. Again, the priority queue is processed until empty. If
 the desired reduction is still not achieved, the remaining vertices are
 split as necessary (in a recursive fashion) so that it is possible to
 eliminate every triangle as necessary.
 
 To use this object, at a minimum you need to specify the ivar
 TargetReduction. The algorithm is guaranteed to generate a reduced mesh
 at this level as long as the following four conditions are met: 1)
 topology modification is allowed (i.e., the ivar PreserveTopology is off);
 2) mesh splitting is enabled (i.e., the ivar Splitting is on); 3) the
 algorithm is allowed to modify the boundary of the mesh (i.e., the ivar
 BoundaryVertexDeletion is on); and 4) the maximum allowable error (i.e.,
 the ivar MaximumError) is set to VTK_DOUBLE_MAX.  Other important
 parameters to adjust include the FeatureAngle and SplitAngle ivars, since
 these can impact the quality of the final mesh. Also, you can set the
 ivar AccumulateError to force incremental error update and distribution
 to surrounding vertices as each vertex is deleted. The accumulated error
 is a conservative global error bounds and decimation error, but requires
 additional memory and time to compute.
