<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkEdgePoints is a filter that takes as input any dataset and 
 generates for output a set of points that lie on an isosurface. The 
 points are created by interpolation along cells edges whose end-points are 
 below and above the contour value.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkEdgePoints, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkEdgePoints
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkEdgePoints = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkEdgePoints = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetValue (double )</code> -  Set/get the contour value.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetValue ()</code> -  Set/get the contour value.
