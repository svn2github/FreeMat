<H3>Usage</H3>
 This filter extracts the point data from a time sequence and specified index
 and creates an output of the same type as the input but with Points 
 containing "number of time steps" points; the point and PointData 
 corresponding to the PointIndex are extracted at each time step and added to
 the output.  A PointData array is added called "Time" (or "TimeData" if
 there is already an array called "Time"), which is the time at each index.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkExtractDataOverTime, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkExtractDataOverTime
