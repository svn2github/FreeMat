<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry extracts from its input vtkPolyData all cells
 that are either completely inside or outside of a specified implicit
 function. This filter is specialized to vtkPolyData. On output the 
 filter generates vtkPolyData.
<P>
 To use this filter you must specify an implicit function. You must also
 specify whether to extract cells lying inside or outside of the implicit 
 function. (The inside of an implicit function is the negative values 
 region.) An option exists to extract cells that are neither inside nor
 outside (i.e., boundary).
<P>
 A more general version of this filter is available for arbitrary
 vtkDataSet input (see vtkExtractGeometry).
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>long = obj.GetMTime ()</code> -  Return the MTime taking into account changes to the implicit function
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetImplicitFunction (vtkImplicitFunction )</code> -  Specify the implicit function for inside/outside checks.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImplicitFunction = obj.GetImplicitFunction ()</code> -  Specify the implicit function for inside/outside checks.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetExtractInside (int )</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetExtractInside ()</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ExtractInsideOn ()</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ExtractInsideOff ()</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetExtractBoundaryCells (int )</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetExtractBoundaryCells ()</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ExtractBoundaryCellsOn ()</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ExtractBoundaryCellsOff ()</code> -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.
