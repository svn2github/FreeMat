<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkExtractSelectedLocations extracts all cells whose volume contain at least 
 one point listed in the LOCATIONS content of the vtkSelection. This filter 
 adds a scalar array called vtkOriginalCellIds that says what input cell 
 produced each output cell. This is an example of a Pedigree ID which helps
 to trace back results.
