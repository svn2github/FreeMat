<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkExtractSelectedThresholds extracts all cells and points with attribute 
 values that lie within a vtkSelection's THRESHOLD contents. The selecion
 can specify to threshold a particular array within either the point or cell
 attribute data of the input. This is similar to vtkThreshold
 but allows mutliple thresholds ranges.
 This filter adds a scalar array called vtkOriginalCellIds that says what 
 input cell produced each output cell. This is an example of a Pedigree ID 
 which helps to trace back results.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkExtractSelectedThresholds, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkExtractSelectedThresholds
