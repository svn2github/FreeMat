<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkExtractTemporalFieldData extracts arrays from the input vtkFieldData. 
 These arrays are assumed to contain temporal data, where the nth tuple 
 contains the value for the nth timestep. 
 The output is a 1D rectilinear grid where the 
 XCoordinates correspond to time (the same array is also copied to
 a point array named Time or TimeData (if Time exists in the input).
 This algorithm does not produce a TIME_STEPS or TIME_RANGE information
 because it works across time. 
 .Section Caveat
 vtkExtractTemporalFieldData puts a vtkOnePieceExtentTranslator in the
 output during RequestInformation(). As a result, the same whole 
 extented is produced independent of the piece request.
 This algorithm works only with source that produce TIME_STEPS().
 Continuous time range is not yet supported.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkExtractTemporalFieldData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkExtractTemporalFieldData
