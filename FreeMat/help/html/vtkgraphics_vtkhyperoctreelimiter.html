<H3>Usage</H3>
 This filter returns a lower resolution copy of its input vtkHyperOctree.
 It does a length/area/volume weighted averaging to obtain data at each
 cut point. Above the cut level, leaf attribute data is simply copied.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkHyperOctreeLimiter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkHyperOctreeLimiter
</PRE>
