<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkMeshQuality computes one or more functions of (geometric)
 quality for each 2-D and 3-D cell (triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedron,
 or hexahedron) of a mesh. These functions of quality are then averaged
 over the entire mesh. The minimum, average, maximum, and unbiased variance
 of quality for each type of cell is stored in the output mesh's FieldData.
 The FieldData arrays are named "Mesh Triangle Quality,"
 "Mesh Quadrilateral Quality," "Mesh Tetrahedron Quality,"
 and "Mesh Hexahedron Quality." Each array has a single tuple
 with 5 components. The first 4 components are the quality statistics
 mentioned above; the final value is the number of cells of the given type.
 This final component makes aggregation of statistics for distributed
 mesh data possible.
<P>
 By default, the per-cell quality is added to the mesh's cell data, in
 an array named "Quality." Cell types not supported by
 this filter will have an entry of 0. Use SaveCellQualityOff() to
 store only the final statistics.
<P>
 This version of the filter written by Philippe Pebay and David Thompson
 overtakes an older version written by Leila Baghdadi, Hanif Ladak, and 
 David Steinman at the Imaging Research Labs, Robarts Research Institute.
 That version only supported tetrahedral radius ratio. See the 
 CompatibilityModeOn() member for information on how to make this filter 
 behave like the previous implementation.

 also use CompatibilityModeOn()/Off() to enter this mode.
 In this mode, cells other than tetrahedra will have report

<LI>  <code>obj.SetCompatibilityMode (int cm)</code> -  CompatibilityMode governs whether, when both a quality function
 and cell volume are to be stored as cell data, the two values
 are stored in a single array. When compatibility mode is off
 (the default), two separate arrays are used -- one labeled
 "Quality" and the other labeled "Volume".
 When compatibility mode is on, both values are stored in a
 single array, with volume as the first component and quality
 as the second component.

 Enabling CompatibilityMode changes the default tetrahedral
 quality function to VTK_QUALITY_RADIUS_RATIO and turns volume
 computation on. (This matches the default behavior of the
 initial implementation of vtkMeshQuality.) You may change
 quality function and volume computation without leaving
 compatibility mode.

 Disabling compatibility mode does not affect the current
 volume computation or tetrahedral quality function settings. 

 The final caveat to CompatibilityMode is that regardless of
 its setting, the resulting array will be of type vtkDoubleArray
 rather than the original vtkFloatArray.
 This is a safety function to keep the authors from
 diving off of the Combinatorial Coding Cliff into
 Certain Insanity.
