<H3>Usage</H3>
 This filter can be substituted for a chain of several vtkThreshold filters
 and can also perform more sophisticated subsetting operations.
 It generates a vtkMultiBlockDataSet as its output.
 This multiblock dataset contains a vtkUnstructuredGrid for each thresholded
 subset you request.
 A thresholded subset can be a set defined by an interval over a
 point or cell attribute of the mesh; these subsets are called IntervalSets.
 A thresholded subset can also be a boolean combination of one or more IntervalSets;
 these subsets are called BooleanSets.
 BooleanSets allow complex logic since their output
 can depend on multiple intervals over multiple variables
 defined on the input mesh.
 This is useful because it eliminates the need for thresholding several
 times and then appending the results, as can be required with vtkThreshold
 when one wants to remove some range of values (e.g., a notch filter).
 Cells are not repeated when they belong to more than one interval unless
 those intervals have different output grids.
<P>
 Another advantage this filter provides over vtkThreshold is the ability
 to threshold on non-scalar (i.e., vector, tensor, etc.) attributes without
 first computing an array containing some norm of the desired attribute.

 This filter makes a distinction between intermediate subsets and
 subsets that will be output to a grid.
 Each intermediate subset you create with AddIntervalSet or
 AddBooleanSet is given a unique integer identifier (via the return
 values of these member functions).
 If you wish for a given set to be output, you must call
 OutputSet and pass it one of these identifiers.
 The return of OutputSet is the integer index of the output set
 in the multiblock dataset created by this filter.
<P>
 For example, if an input mesh defined three attributes T, P, and s, one might
 wish to find cells that satisfy "T &lt; 320 [K] &amp;&amp; ( P &gt; 101 [kPa] || s &lt; 0.1 [kJ/kg/K] )".
 To accomplish this with a vtkMultiThreshold filter,
 &lt;pre&gt;
 vtkMultiThreshold* thr;
 int intervalSets[3];
<P>
 intervalSets[0] = thr-&gt;AddIntervalSet( vtkMath::NegInf(), 320., vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED, vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN,
     vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS, "T", 0, 1 );
 intervalSets[1] = thr-&gt;AddIntervalSet( 101., vtkMath::Inf(), vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN, vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED,
     vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_CELLS, "P", 0, 1 );
 intervalSets[2] = thr-&gt;AddIntervalSet( vtkMath::NegInf(), 0.1, vtkMultiThreshold::CLOSED, vtkMultiThreshold::OPEN,
     vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS, "s", 0, 1 );
<P>
 int intermediate = thr-&gt;AddBooleanSet( vtkMultiThreshold::OR, 2, &amp;intervalSets[1] );
<P>
 int intersection[2];
 intersection[0] = intervalSets[0];
 intersection[1] = intermediate;
 int outputSet = thr-&gt;AddBooleanSet( vtkMultiThreshold::AND, 2, intersection );
<P>
 int outputGridIndex = thr-&gt;OutputSet( outputSet );
 thr-&gt;Update();
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The result of this filter will be a multiblock dataset that contains a single child with the desired cells.
 If we had also called &lt;code&gt;thr-&gt;OutputSet( intervalSets[0] );&lt;/code&gt;, there would be two child meshes and
 one would contain all cells with T &lt; 320 [K].
 In that case, the output can be represented by this graph
 \dot
 digraph MultiThreshold {
   set0 [shape=rect,style=filled,label="point T(0) in [-Inf,320["]
   set1 [shape=rect,label="cell P(0) in ]101,Inf]"]
   set2 [shape=rect,label="point s(0) in [-Inf,0.1["]
   set3 [shape=rect,label="OR"]
   set4 [shape=rect,style=filled,label="AND"]
   set0 -&gt; set4
   set1 -&gt; set3
   set2 -&gt; set3
   set3 -&gt; set4
 }
 \enddot
 The filled rectangles represent sets that are output.

To create an instance of class vtkMultiThreshold, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkMultiThreshold

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkMultiThreshold has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkMultiThreshold class.

<LI>  <code>int = obj.AddLowpassIntervalSet (double xmax, int assoc, string arrayName, int component, int allScalars)</code> -  These convenience members make it easy to insert closed intervals.
 The "notch" interval is accomplished by creating a bandpass interval and applying a NAND operation.
 In this case, the set ID returned in the NAND operation set ID.
 Note that you can pass xmin == xmax when creating a bandpass threshold to retrieve elements matching exactly
 one value (since the intervals created by these routines are closed).
