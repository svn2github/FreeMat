<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkOBBDicer separates the cells of a dataset into spatially
 aggregated pieces using a Oriented Bounding Box (OBB). These pieces
 can then be operated on by other filters (e.g., vtkThreshold). One
 application is to break very large polygonal models into pieces and
 performing viewing and occlusion culling on the pieces.
<P>
 Refer to the superclass documentation (vtkDicer) for more information.

To create an instance of class vtkOBBDicer, simply
