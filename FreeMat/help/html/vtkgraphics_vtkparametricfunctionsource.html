Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkgraphics.html> Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 This class tessellates parametric functions. The user must specify how
 many points in the parametric coordinate directions are required (i.e.,
 the resolution), and the mode to use to generate scalars. 
<P>
 .SECTION Thanks

 SCALAR_MODULUS, the scalar is set to (sqrt(u*u+v*v)), this is measured relative to (u_avg,v_avg).
 SCALAR_PHASE, the scalar is set to (atan2(v,u)) (in degrees, 0 to 360), this is measured relative to (u_avg,v_avg).
 SCALAR_QUADRANT, the scalar is set to 1, 2, 3 or 4 
   depending upon the quadrant of the point (u,v).
 SCALAR_X, the scalar is set to the x-value. 
 SCALAR_Y, the scalar is set to the y-value. 
 SCALAR_Z, the scalar is set to the z-value. 
 SCALAR_DISTANCE, the scalar is set to (sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z)). I.e. distance from the origin.
 SCALAR_FUNCTION_DEFINED, the scalar is set to the value returned from EvaluateScalar().
