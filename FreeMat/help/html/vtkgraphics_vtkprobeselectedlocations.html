<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkProbeSelectedLocations is similar to vtkExtractSelectedLocations except
 that it interpolates the point attributes at the probe location. This is
 equivalent to the vtkProbeFilter except that the probe locations are provided
 by a vtkSelection. The FieldType of the input vtkSelection is immaterial and
 is ignored. The ContentType of the input vtkSelection must be
 vtkSelection::LOCATIONS.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkProbeSelectedLocations, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkProbeSelectedLocations
