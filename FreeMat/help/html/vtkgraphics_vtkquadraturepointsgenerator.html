<H3>Usage</H3>
<P>
 Create a vtkPolyData on its output containing the vertices
 for the quadrature points for one of the vtkDataArrays present
 on its input vtkUnstructuredGrid. If the input data set has
 has FieldData generated by vtkQuadraturePointInterpolator then
 this will be set as point data. Note: Point sets are generated
 per field array. This is because each field array may contain
 its own dictionary.
