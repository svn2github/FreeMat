<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkQuadricClustering is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a
 triangle mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry.  The
 input to vtkQuadricClustering is a vtkPolyData object, and all types of
 polygonal data are handled.
<P>
 The algorithm used is the one described by Peter Lindstrom in his Siggraph
 2000 paper, "Out-of-Core Simplification of Large Polygonal Models."  The
 general approach of the algorithm is to cluster vertices in a uniform
 binning of space, accumulating the quadric of each triangle (pushed out to
 the triangles vertices) within each bin, and then determining an optimal
 position for a single vertex in a bin by using the accumulated quadric. In
 more detail, the algorithm first gets the bounds of the input poly data.
 It then breaks this bounding volume into a user-specified number of
 spatial bins.  It then reads each triangle from the input and hashes its
 vertices into these bins.  (If this is the first time a bin has been
 visited, initialize its quadric to the 0 matrix.) The algorithm computes
 the error quadric for this triangle and adds it to the existing quadric of
 the bin in which each vertex is contained. Then, if 2 or more vertices of
 the triangle fall in the same bin, the triangle is dicarded.  If the
 triangle is not discarded, it adds the triangle to the list of output
 triangles as a list of vertex identifiers.  (There is one vertex id per
 bin.)  After all the triangles have been read, the representative vertex
 for each bin is computed (an optimal location is found) using the quadric
 for that bin.  This determines the spatial location of the vertices of
 each of the triangles in the output.
<P>
 To use this filter, specify the divisions defining the spatial subdivision
 in the x, y, and z directions. You must also specify an input vtkPolyData.
 Then choose to either 1) use the original points that minimize the quadric
 error to produce the output triangles or 2) compute an optimal position in
 each bin to produce the output triangles (recommended and default behavior).
<P>
 This filter can take multiple inputs.  To do this, the user must explicity
 call StartAppend, Append (once for each input), and EndAppend.  StartAppend
 sets up the data structure to hold the quadric matrices.  Append processes
 each triangle in the input poly data it was called on, hashes its vertices
 to the appropriate bins, determines whether to keep this triangle, and
 updates the appropriate quadric matrices.  EndAppend determines the spatial
 location of each of the representative vertices for the visited bins. While
 this approach does not fit into the visualization architecture and requires
 manual control, it has the advantage that extremely large data can be 
 processed in pieces and appended to the filter piece-by-piece.
