<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkRandomAttributeGenerator is a filter that creates random attributes
 including scalars, vectors, normals, tensors, texture coordinates and/or
 general data arrays. These attributes can be generated as point data, cell
 data or general field data. The generation of each component is normalized
 between a user-specified minimum and maximum value.
<P>
 This filter provides that capability to specify the data type of the
 attributes, the range for each of the components, and the number of
 components. Note, however, that this flexibility only goes so far because
 some attributes (e.g., normals, vectors and tensors) are fixed in the
 number of components, and in the case of normals and tensors, are
 constrained in the values that some of the components can take (i.e., 
 normals have magnitude one, and tensors are symmetric).
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkRandomAttributeGenerator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkRandomAttributeGenerator
