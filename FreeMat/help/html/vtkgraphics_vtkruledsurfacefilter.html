<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkRuledSurfaceFilter is a filter that generates a surface from a set of
 lines. The lines are assumed to be "parallel" in the sense that they do
 not intersect and remain somewhat close to one another. A surface is
 generated by connecting the points defining each pair of lines with
 straight lines. This creates a strip for each pair of lines (i.e., a
 triangulation is created from two generating lines). The filter can handle
 an arbitrary number of lines, with lines i and i+1 assumed connected.
 Note that there are several different approaches for creating the ruled
 surface, the method for creating the surface can either use the input
 points or resample from the polylines (using a user-specified resolution).
<P>
 This filter offers some other important features. A DistanceFactor ivar is
 used to decide when two lines are too far apart to connect. (The factor is
 a multiple of the distance between the first two points of the two lines
 defining the strip.) If the distance between the two generating lines
 becomes too great, then the surface is not generated in that
 region. (Note: if the lines separate and then merge, then a hole can be
 generated in the surface.) In addition, the Offset and OnRation ivars can
 be used to create nifty striped surfaces. Closed surfaces (e.g., tubes) can
 be created by setting the CloseSurface ivar. (The surface can be closed
 in the other direction by repeating the first and last point in the
 polylines defining the surface.)
<P>
 An important use of this filter is to combine it with vtkStreamLine to
 generate stream surfaces. It can also be used to create surfaces from
 contours.

To create an instance of class vtkRuledSurfaceFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
