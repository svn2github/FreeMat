<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkStreamer is a filter that integrates a massless particle through a vector
 field. The integration is performed using second order Runge-Kutta method. 
 vtkStreamer often serves as a base class for other classes that perform 
 numerical integration through a vector field (e.g., vtkStreamLine).
<P>
 Note that vtkStreamer can integrate both forward and backward in time,
 or in both directions. The length of the streamer is controlled by 
 specifying an elapsed time. (The elapsed time is the time each particle 
 travels.) Otherwise, the integration terminates after exiting the dataset or
 if the particle speed is reduced to a value less than the terminal speed.
<P>
 vtkStreamer integrates through any type of dataset. As a result, if the 
 dataset contains 2D cells such as polygons or triangles, the integration is
 constrained to lie on the surface defined by the 2D cells.
<P>
 The starting point of streamers may be defined in three different ways.
 Starting from global x-y-z "position" allows you to start a single streamer
 at a specified x-y-z coordinate. Starting from "location" allows you to 
 start at a specified cell, subId, and parametric coordinate. Finally, you 
 may specify a source object to start multiple streamers. If you start 
 streamers using a source object, for each point in the source that is 
 inside the dataset a streamer is created.
<P>
 vtkStreamer implements the integration process in the Integrate() method.
 Because vtkStreamer does not implement the Execute() method that its 
 superclass (i.e., Filter) requires, it is an abstract class. Its subclasses
 implement the execute method and use the Integrate() method, and then build
 their own representation of the integration path (i.e., lines, dashed 
 lines, points, etc.).
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkStreamer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkStreamer
