<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkStreamTracer is a filter that integrates a vector field to generate
 streamlines. The integration is performed using a specified integrator,
 by default Runge-Kutta2. 
 
 vtkStreamTracer produces polylines as the output, with each cell (i.e.,
 polyline) representing a streamline. The attribute values associated
 with each streamline are stored in the cell data, whereas those
 associated with streamline-points are stored in the point data.
<P>
 vtkStreamTracer supports forward (the default), backward, and combined
 (i.e., BOTH) integration. The length of a streamline is governed by 
 specifying a maximum value either in physical arc length or in (local)
 cell length. Otherwise, the integration terminates upon exiting the
 flow field domain, or if the particle speed is reduced to a value less
 than a specified terminal speed, or when a maximum number of steps is 
 completed. The specific reason for the termination is stored in a cell 
 array named ReasonForTermination.
<P>
 Note that normalized vectors are adopted in streamline integration,
 which achieves high numerical accuracy/smoothness of flow lines that is
 particularly guranteed for Runge-Kutta45 with adaptive step size and
 error control). In support of this feature, the underlying step size is
 ALWAYS in arc length unit (LENGTH_UNIT) while the 'real' time interval 
 (virtual for steady flows) that a particle actually takes to trave in a 
 single step is obtained by dividing the arc length by the LOCAL speed. 
 The overall elapsed time (i.e., the life span) of the particle is the 
 sum of those individual step-wise time intervals.
<P>
 The quality of streamline integration can be controlled by setting the
 initial integration step (InitialIntegrationStep), particularly for 
 Runge-Kutta2 and Runge-Kutta4 (with a fixed step size), and in the case
 of Runge-Kutta45 (with an adaptive step size and error control) the
 minimum integration step, the maximum integration step, and the maximum
 error. These steps are in either LENGTH_UNIT or CELL_LENGTH_UNIT while
 the error is in physical arc length. For the former two integrators,
 there is a trade-off between integration speed and streamline quality.
<P>
 The integration time, vorticity, rotation and angular velocity are stored
 in point data arrays named "IntegrationTime", "Vorticity", "Rotation" and
 "AngularVelocity", respectively (vorticity, rotation and angular velocity
 are computed only when ComputeVorticity is on). All point data attributes
 in the source dataset are interpolated on the new streamline points.
<P>
 vtkStreamTracer supports integration through any type of dataset. Thus if
 the dataset contains 2D cells like polygons or triangles, the integration
 is constrained to lie on the surface defined by 2D cells.
<P>
 The starting point, or the so-called 'seed', of a streamline may be set
 in two different ways. Starting from global x-y-z "position" allows you
 to start a single trace at a specified x-y-z coordinate. If you specify
 a source object, traces will be generated from each point in the source
 that is inside the dataset.
