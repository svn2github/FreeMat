<H3>Usage</H3>
<P>
 Given an input that changes over time, vtkTemporalStatistics looks at the
 data for each time step and computes some statistical information of how a
 point or cell variable changes over time.  For example, vtkTemporalStatistics
 can compute the average value of "pressure" over time of each point.
<P>
 Note that this filter will require the upstream filter to be run on every
 time step that it reports that it can compute.  This may be a time consuming
 operation.
<P>
 vtkTemporalStatistics ignores the temporal spacing.  Each timestep will be
 weighted the same regardless of how long of an interval it is to the next
 timestep.  Thus, the average statistic may be quite different from an
 integration of the variable if the time spacing varies.
