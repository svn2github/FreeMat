<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkThreshold is a filter that extracts cells from any dataset type that
 satisfy a threshold criterion. A cell satisfies the criterion if the
 scalar value of (every or any) point satisfies the criterion. The
 criterion can take three forms: 1) greater than a particular value; 2)
 less than a particular value; or 3) between two values. The output of this
 filter is an unstructured grid.
<P>
 Note that scalar values are available from the point and cell attribute
 data.  By default, point data is used to obtain scalars, but you can
 control this behavior. See the AttributeMode ivar below.
<P>
 By default only the first scalar value is used in the decision. Use the ComponentMode
 and SelectedComponent ivars to control this behavior.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkThreshold, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkThreshold

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkThreshold has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkThreshold class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkThreshold = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkThreshold = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ThresholdByLower (double lower)</code> -  Criterion is cells whose scalars are less or equal to lower threshold.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ThresholdByUpper (double upper)</code> -  Criterion is cells whose scalars are greater or equal to upper threshold.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ThresholdBetween (double lower, double upper)</code> -  Criterion is cells whose scalars are between lower and upper thresholds
 (inclusive of the end values).

<LI>  <code>obj.SetAttributeMode (int )</code> -  Control how the filter works with scalar point data and cell attribute
 data.  By default (AttributeModeToDefault), the filter will use point

 used. Alternatively you can explicitly set the filter to use point data
 (AttributeModeToUsePointData) or cell data (AttributeModeToUseCellData).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetAttributeMode ()</code> -  Control how the filter works with scalar point data and cell attribute
 data.  By default (AttributeModeToDefault), the filter will use point

 (AttributeModeToUsePointData) or cell data (AttributeModeToUseCellData).

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetAttributeModeAsString ()</code> -  Control how the filter works with scalar point data and cell attribute
 data.  By default (AttributeModeToDefault), the filter will use point
