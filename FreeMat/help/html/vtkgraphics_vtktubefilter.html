<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkTubeFilter is a filter that generates a tube around each input line. 
 The tubes are made up of triangle strips and rotate around the tube with
 the rotation of the line normals. (If no normals are present, they are
 computed automatically.) The radius of the tube can be set to vary with 
 scalar or vector value. If the radius varies with scalar value the radius
 is linearly adjusted. If the radius varies with vector value, a mass
 flux preserving variation is used. The number of sides for the tube also 
 can be specified. You can also specify which of the sides are visible. This
 is useful for generating interesting striping effects. Other options
 include the ability to cap the tube and generate texture coordinates.
 Texture coordinates can be used with an associated texture map to create
 interesting effects such as marking the tube with stripes corresponding
 to length or time.
<P>
 This filter is typically used to create thick or dramatic lines. Another
 common use is to combine this filter with vtkStreamLine to generate
 streamtubes.

To create an instance of class vtkTubeFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

  obj = vtkTubeFilter
