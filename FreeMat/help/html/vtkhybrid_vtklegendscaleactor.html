<H3>Usage</H3>
 This class is used to annotate the render window. Its basic goal is to
 provide an indication of the scale of the scene. Four axes surrounding the
 render window indicate (in a variety of ways) the scale of what the camera
 is viewing. An option also exists for displaying a scale legend.
<P>
 The axes can be programmed either to display distance scales or x-y
 coordinate values. By default, the scales display a distance. However,
 if you know that the view is down the z-axis, the scales can be programmed
 to display x-y coordinate values.
<P>
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkLegendScaleActor, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkLegendScaleActor

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkLegendScaleActor has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
