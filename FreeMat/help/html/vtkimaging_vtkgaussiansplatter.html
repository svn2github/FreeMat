<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkGaussianSplatter is a filter that injects input points into a
 structured points (volume) dataset. As each point is injected, it "splats"
 or distributes values to nearby voxels. Data is distributed using an
 elliptical, Gaussian distribution function. The distribution function is
 modified using scalar values (expands distribution) or normals
 (creates ellipsoidal distribution rather than spherical).
<P>
 In general, the Gaussian distribution function f(x) around a given
 splat point p is given by
<P>
     f(x) = ScaleFactor * exp( ExponentFactor*((r/Radius)**2) )
<P>
 where x is the current voxel sample point; r is the distance |x-p|
 ExponentFactor &lt;= 0.0, and ScaleFactor can be multiplied by the scalar 
 value of the point p that is currently being splatted.
<P>
 If points normals are present (and NormalWarping is on), then the splat 
 function becomes elliptical (as compared to the spherical one described
 by the previous equation). The Gaussian distribution function then
 becomes:
 
     f(x) = ScaleFactor * 
               exp( ExponentFactor*( ((rxy/E)**2 + z**2)/R**2) )
<P>
 where E is a user-defined eccentricity factor that controls the elliptical
 shape of the splat; z is the distance of the current voxel sample point
 along normal N; and rxy is the distance of x in the direction
 prependicular to N.
<P>
 This class is typically used to convert point-valued distributions into
 a volume representation. The volume is then usually iso-surfaced or
 volume rendered to generate a visualization. It can be used to create
 surfaces from point distributions, or to create structure (i.e.,
 topology) when none exists.

To create an instance of class vtkGaussianSplatter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
