Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkimaging.html> Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 This filter only works on an image after it has been converted to
 frequency domain by a vtkImageFFT filter.  A vtkImageRFFT filter
 can be used to convert the output back into the spatial domain.
 vtkImageButterworthHighPass  the frequency components around 0 are
 attenuated.  Input and output are in doubles, with two components
 (complex numbers).
 out(i, j) = 1 / (1 + pow(CutOff/Freq(i,j), 2*Order));
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkImageButterworthHighPass, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkImageButterworthHighPass
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkImageButterworthHighPass has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.

and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkImageButterworthHighPass class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImageButterworthHighPass = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImageButterworthHighPass = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetCutOff (double , double , double )</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetCutOff (double  a[3])</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetCutOff (double v)</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetXCutOff (double v)</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetYCutOff (double v)</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetZCutOff (double v)</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj. GetCutOff ()</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetXCutOff ()</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetYCutOff ()</code> -  Set/Get the cutoff frequency for each axis.
 The values are specified in the order X, Y, Z, Time.
 Units: Cycles per world unit (as defined by the data spacing).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetZCutOff ()</code> -  The order determines sharpness of the cutoff curve.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetOrder (int )</code> -  The order determines sharpness of the cutoff curve.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetOrder ()</code> -  The order determines sharpness of the cutoff curve.
