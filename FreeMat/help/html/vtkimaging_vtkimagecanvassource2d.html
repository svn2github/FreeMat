<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkImageCanvasSource2D is a source that starts as a blank image.
 you may add to the image with two-dimensional drawing routines.
 It can paint multi-spectral images.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkImageCanvasSource2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkImageCanvasSource2D
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkImageCanvasSource2D has several methods that can be used.
