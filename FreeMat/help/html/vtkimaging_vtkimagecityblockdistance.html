<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkImageCityBlockDistance creates a distance map using the city block
 (Manhatten) distance measure.  The input is a mask.  Zero values are
 considered boundaries.  The output pixel is the minimum of the input pixel
 and the distance to a boundary (or neighbor value + 1 unit).
 distance values are calculated in pixels.
 The filter works by taking 6 passes (for 3d distance map): 2 along each 
 axis (forward and backward). Each pass keeps a running minimum distance.
 For some reason, I preserve the sign if the distance.  If the input 
 mask is initially negative, the output distances will be negative.
 Distances maps can have inside (negative regions) 
 and outsides (positive regions).
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkImageCityBlockDistance, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkImageCityBlockDistance
