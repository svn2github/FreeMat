<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkImageSpatialFilter is a super class for filters that operate on an
 input neighborhood for each output pixel. It handles even sized
 neighborhoods, but their can be a half pixel shift associated with
 processing.  This superclass has some logic for handling boundaries.  It
 can split regions into boundary and non-boundary pieces and call different
 execute methods.
 .SECTION Warning
 This used to be the parent class for most imaging filter in VTK4.x, now 
 this role has been replaced by vtkImageSpatialAlgorithm. You should consider
 using vtkImageSpatialAlgorithm instead, when writing filter for VTK5 and above.
 This class was kept to ensure full backward compatibility.
