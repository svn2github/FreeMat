Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkinfovis.html> Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 Treats matrices as collections of vectors and computes dot-product similarity
 metrics between vectors.
<P>
 The results are returned as an edge-table that lists the index of each vector
 and their computed similarity.  The output edge-table is typically used with
 vtkTableToGraph to create a similarity graph.
<P>
 This filter can be used with one or two input matrices.  If you provide a single
 matrix as input, every vector in the matrix is compared with every other vector. If
 you provide two matrices, every vector in the first matrix is compared with every
 vector in the second matrix.
<P>
 Note that this filter *only* computes the dot-product between each pair of vectors;
 if you want to compute the cosine of the angles between vectors, you will need to
 normalize the inputs yourself.
<P>
 Inputs:
   Input port 0: (required) A vtkDenseArray&lt;double&gt; with two dimensions (a matrix).
   Input port 1: (optional) A vtkDenseArray&lt;double&gt; with two dimensions (a matrix).
<P>
 Outputs:
   Output port 0: A vtkTable containing "source", "target", and "similarity" columns.
<P>

To create an instance of class vtkDotProductSimilarity, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkDotProductSimilarity
