<H3>Usage</H3>
 Lays out a graph in 2D or 3D using a force-directed algorithm.
 The user may specify whether to layout the graph randomly initially,
 the bounds, the number of dimensions (2 or 3), and the cool-down rate.
<P>
 .SECTION Thanks
 Thanks to Brian Wylie for adding functionality for allowing this layout
 to be incremental.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkForceDirectedLayoutStrategy, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkForceDirectedLayoutStrategy

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkForceDirectedLayoutStrategy has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkForceDirectedLayoutStrategy class.

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetRandomSeed (int )</code> -  Seed the random number generator used to jitter point positions.
 This has a significant effect on their final positions when
 the layout is complete.

<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetRandomSeedMinValue ()</code> -  Seed the random number generator used to jitter point positions.
 This has a significant effect on their final positions when
 the layout is complete.

 the layout is complete.

 the layout is complete.

<LI>  <code>obj.SetGraphBounds (double , double , double , double , double , double )</code> -  Set / get the region in space in which to place the final graph.

 is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetAutomaticBoundsComputation (int )</code> -  Turn on/off automatic graph bounds calculation. If this
 boolean is off, then the manually specified GraphBounds is used.

 boolean is off, then the manually specified GraphBounds is used.

 entirely layout the graph or iteratively lay out the
 graph. If you have an iterative layout please implement
