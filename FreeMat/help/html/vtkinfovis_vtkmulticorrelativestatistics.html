<H3>Usage</H3>
 Given a selection of sets of columns of interest, this class provides the
 following functionalities, depending on the execution mode it is executed in:
 * Learn: calculates means, unbiased variance and covariance estimators of
   column pairs coefficient.
   More precisely, Learn calculates the averages and centered
   variance/covariance sums; if \p finalize is set to true (default),
   the final statistics are calculated.
   The output metadata on port OUTPUT_MODEL is a multiblock dataset containing at a minimum
   one vtkTable holding the raw sums in a sparse matrix style. If \a finalize is
   true, then one additional vtkTable will be present for each requested set of
   column correlations. These additional tables contain column averages, the
   upper triangular portion of the covariance matrix (in the upper right hand
   portion of the table) and the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix
   (in the lower portion of the table beneath the covariance triangle).
   The leftmost column will be a vector of column averages.
   The last entry in the column averages vector is the number of samples.
   As an example, consider a request for a 3-column correlation with columns
   named ColA, ColB, and ColC.
   The resulting table will look like this:
   &lt;pre&gt;
      Column  |Mean     |ColA     |ColB     |ColC
      --------+---------+---------+---------+---------
      ColA    |avg(A)   |cov(A,A) |cov(A,B) |cov(A,C)
      ColB    |avg(B)   |chol(1,1)|cov(B,B) |cov(B,C)
      ColC    |avg(C)   |chol(2,1)|chol(2,2)|cov(C,C)
      Cholesky|length(A)|chol(3,1)|chol(3,2)|chol(3,3)
   &lt;/pre&gt;
 * Assess: given a set of results matrices as specified above in input port INPUT_MODEL and
   tabular data on input port INPUT_DATA that contains column names matching those
   of the tables on input port INPUT_MODEL, the assess mode computes the relative
   deviation of each observation in port INPUT_DATA's table according to the linear
   correlations implied by each table in port INPUT_MODEL.
