<H3>Usage</H3>
 This filter preserves all the topology of the input, but only a subset of
 arrays are passed to the output. Add an array to be passed to the output
 data object with AddArray(). If RemoveArrays is on, the specified arrays will
 be the ones that are removed instead of the ones that are kept.
<P>
 Arrays with special attributes (scalars, pedigree ids, etc.) will retain those
 attributes in the output.
<P>
 By default, only those field types with at least one array specified through
 AddArray will be processed. If instead UseFieldTypes
 is turned on, you explicitly set which field types to process with AddFieldType.
<P>
 Example 1:
<P>
 &lt;pre&gt;
 passArray-&gt;AddArray(vtkDataObject::POINT, "velocity");
 &lt;/pre&gt;
<P>
 The output will have only that one array "velocity" in the
 point data, but cell and field data will be untouched.
<P>
 Example 2:
<P>
 &lt;pre&gt;
 passArray-&gt;AddArray(vtkDataObject::POINT, "velocity");
 passArray-&gt;UseFieldTypesOn();
 passArray-&gt;AddFieldType(vtkDataObject::POINT);
 passArray-&gt;AddFieldType(vtkDataObject::CELL);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
<P>
 The point data would still contain the single array, but the cell data
 would be cleared since you did not specify any arrays to pass. Field data would
 still be untouched.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkPassArrays, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkPassArrays
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkPassArrays has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkPassArrays class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkPassArrays = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkPassArrays = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.AddArray (int fieldType, string name)</code> -  Adds an array to pass through.
 fieldType where the array that should be passed (point data, cell data, etc.).
 It should be one of the constants defined in the vtkDataObject::AttributeTypes
 enumeration.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ClearArrays ()</code> -  Clear all arrays to pass through.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetRemoveArrays (bool )</code> -  Instead of passing only the specified arrays, remove the specified arrays
 and keep all other arrays. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>bool = obj.GetRemoveArrays ()</code> -  Instead of passing only the specified arrays, remove the specified arrays
 and keep all other arrays. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.RemoveArraysOn ()</code> -  Instead of passing only the specified arrays, remove the specified arrays
 and keep all other arrays. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.RemoveArraysOff ()</code> -  Instead of passing only the specified arrays, remove the specified arrays
 and keep all other arrays. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetUseFieldTypes (bool )</code> -  Process only those field types explicitly specified with AddFieldType.
 Otherwise, processes field types associated with at least one specified
 array. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>bool = obj.GetUseFieldTypes ()</code> -  Process only those field types explicitly specified with AddFieldType.
 Otherwise, processes field types associated with at least one specified
 array. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.UseFieldTypesOn ()</code> -  Process only those field types explicitly specified with AddFieldType.
 Otherwise, processes field types associated with at least one specified
 array. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.UseFieldTypesOff ()</code> -  Process only those field types explicitly specified with AddFieldType.
 Otherwise, processes field types associated with at least one specified
 array. Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.AddFieldType (int fieldType)</code> -  Add a field type to process.
 fieldType where the array that should be passed (point data, cell data, etc.).
 It should be one of the constants defined in the vtkDataObject::AttributeTypes
 enumeration.
 NOTE: These are only used if UseFieldType is turned on.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ClearFieldTypes ()</code> -  Clear all field types to process.
