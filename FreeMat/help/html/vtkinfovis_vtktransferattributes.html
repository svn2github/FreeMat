<H3>Usage</H3>
 The filter requires
 both a vtkGraph and vtkTree as input.  The tree vertices must be a
 superset of the graph vertices.  A common example is when the graph vertices
 correspond to the leaves of the tree, but the internal vertices of the tree
 represent groupings of graph vertices.  The algorithm matches the vertices
 using the array "PedigreeId".  The user may alternately set the
 DirectMapping flag to indicate that the two structures must have directly
 corresponding offsets (i.e. node i in the graph must correspond to node i in
 the tree).

To create an instance of class vtkTransferAttributes, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkTransferAttributes has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkTransferAttributes class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTransferAttributes = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTransferAttributes = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetDirectMapping (bool )</code> -  If on, uses direct mapping from tree to graph vertices.
 If off, both the graph and tree must contain PedigreeId arrays
 which are used to match graph and tree vertices.
 Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>bool = obj.GetDirectMapping ()</code> -  If on, uses direct mapping from tree to graph vertices.
 If off, both the graph and tree must contain PedigreeId arrays
 which are used to match graph and tree vertices.
 Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.DirectMappingOn ()</code> -  If on, uses direct mapping from tree to graph vertices.
 If off, both the graph and tree must contain PedigreeId arrays
 which are used to match graph and tree vertices.
 Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.DirectMappingOff ()</code> -  If on, uses direct mapping from tree to graph vertices.
 If off, both the graph and tree must contain PedigreeId arrays
 which are used to match graph and tree vertices.
 Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetSourceArrayName ()</code> -  The field name to use for storing the source array.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetSourceArrayName (string )</code> -  The field name to use for storing the source array.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetTargetArrayName ()</code> -  The field name to use for storing the source array.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetTargetArrayName (string )</code> -  The field name to use for storing the source array.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetSourceFieldType ()</code> -  The source field type for accessing the source array. Valid values are
 those from enum vtkDataObject::FieldAssociations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetSourceFieldType (int )</code> -  The source field type for accessing the source array. Valid values are
 those from enum vtkDataObject::FieldAssociations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetTargetFieldType ()</code> -  The target field type for accessing the target array. Valid values are
 those from enum vtkDataObject::FieldAssociations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetTargetFieldType (int )</code> -  The target field type for accessing the target array. Valid values are
 those from enum vtkDataObject::FieldAssociations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.FillInputPortInformation (int port, vtkInformation info)</code> -  Set the input type of the algorithm to vtkGraph.
