Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkinfovis.html> Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 Assigns points to the nodes of a tree to an orbital layout. Each parent
 is orbited by its children, recursively.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Layout ()</code> -  Perform the orbital layout.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetLogSpacingValue (double )</code> -  The spacing of orbital levels. Levels near zero give more space
 to levels near the root, while levels near one (the default)
 create evenly-spaced levels. Levels above one give more space
 to levels near the leaves.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetLogSpacingValue ()</code> -  The spacing of orbital levels. Levels near zero give more space
 to levels near the root, while levels near one (the default)
 create evenly-spaced levels. Levels above one give more space
 to levels near the leaves.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetLeafSpacing (double )</code> -  The spacing of leaves.  Levels near one evenly space leaves
 with no gaps between subtrees.  Levels near zero creates
 large gaps between subtrees.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetLeafSpacingMinValue ()</code> -  The spacing of leaves.  Levels near one evenly space leaves
 with no gaps between subtrees.  Levels near zero creates
 large gaps between subtrees.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetLeafSpacingMaxValue ()</code> -  The spacing of leaves.  Levels near one evenly space leaves
 with no gaps between subtrees.  Levels near zero creates
 large gaps between subtrees.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetLeafSpacing ()</code> -  The spacing of leaves.  Levels near one evenly space leaves
 with no gaps between subtrees.  Levels near zero creates
 large gaps between subtrees.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetChildRadiusFactor (double )</code> -  This is a magic number right now. Controls the radius
 of the child layout, all of this should be fixed at
 some point with a more logical layout. Defaults to .5 :)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetChildRadiusFactor ()</code> -  This is a magic number right now. Controls the radius
 of the child layout, all of this should be fixed at
 some point with a more logical layout. Defaults to .5 :)
