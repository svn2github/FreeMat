<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkEnSightGoldReader is a class to read EnSight Gold files into vtk.
 Because the different parts of the EnSight data can be of various data
 types, this reader produces multiple outputs, one per part in the input
 file.
 All variable information is being stored in field data.  The descriptions
 listed in the case file are used as the array names in the field data.
 For complex vector variables, the description is appended with _r (for the
 array of real values) and _i (for the array if imaginary values).  Complex
 scalar variables are stored as a single array with 2 components, real and
 imaginary, listed in that order.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkEnSightGoldReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkEnSightGoldReader
