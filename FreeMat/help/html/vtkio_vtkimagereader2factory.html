<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkImageReader2Factory: This class is used to create a vtkImageReader2
 object given a path name to a file.  It calls CanReadFile on all
 available readers until one of them returns true.  The available reader
 list comes from three places.  In the InitializeReaders function of this
 class, built-in VTK classes are added to the list, users can call
 RegisterReader, or users can create a vtkObjectFactory that has
 CreateObject method that returns a new vtkImageReader2 sub class when
 given the string "vtkImageReaderObject".  This way applications can be
 extended with new readers via a plugin dll or by calling RegisterReader.
 Of course all of the readers that are part of the vtk release are made
 automatically available.
