<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkPLOT3DReader is a reader object that reads PLOT3D formatted files and 
 generates structured grid(s) on output. PLOT3D is a computer graphics 
 program designed to visualize the grids and solutions of computational 
 fluid dynamics. Please see the "PLOT3D User's Manual" available from 
 NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field CA.
<P>
 PLOT3D files consist of a grid file (also known as XYZ file), an 
 optional solution file (also known as a Q file), and an optional function 
 file that contains user created data (currently unsupported). The Q file 
 contains solution  information as follows: the four parameters free stream 
 mach number (Fsmach), angle of attack (Alpha), Reynolds number (Re), and 
 total integration time (Time). This information is stored in an array
 called Properties in the FieldData of each output (tuple 0: fsmach, tuple 1:
 alpha, tuple 2: re, tuple 3: time). In addition, the solution file contains 
 the flow density (scalar), flow momentum (vector), and flow energy (scalar).
<P>
 The reader can generate additional scalars and vectors (or "functions")
 from this information. To use vtkPLOT3DReader, you must specify the 
 particular function number for the scalar and vector you want to visualize.
 This implementation of the reader provides the following functions. The
 scalar functions are:
    -1  - don't read or compute any scalars
    100 - density
    110 - pressure
    120 - temperature
    130 - enthalpy
    140 - internal energy
    144 - kinetic energy
    153 - velocity magnitude
    163 - stagnation energy
    170 - entropy
    184 - swirl.
<P>
 The vector functions are:
    -1  - don't read or compute any vectors
    200 - velocity
    201 - vorticity
    202 - momentum
    210 - pressure gradient.
<P>
 (Other functions are described in the PLOT3D spec, but only those listed are
 implemented here.) Note that by default, this reader creates the density 
 scalar (100) and momentum vector (202) as output. (These are just read in
 from the solution file.) Please note that the validity of computation is
 a function of this class's gas constants (R, Gamma) and the equations used.
 They may not be suitable for your computational domain.
<P>
 Additionally, you can read other data and associate it as a vtkDataArray
 into the output's point attribute data. Use the method AddFunction()
 to list all the functions that you'd like to read. AddFunction() accepts
 an integer parameter that defines the function number.
<P>

To create an instance of class vtkPLOT3DReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkPLOT3DReader has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkPLOT3DReader class.

 This number is equal to the number of grids in the current 
 file. This method has to be called before getting any output
 if the number of outputs will be greater than 1 (the first

 is invoked, the header file is opened and part of the header 
 is read.
