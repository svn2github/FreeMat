<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkSTLWriter writes stereo lithography (.stl) files in either ASCII or
 binary form. Stereo lithography files only contain triangles. If polygons
 with more than 3 vertices are present, only the first 3 vertices are
 written.  Use vtkTriangleFilter to convert polygons to triangles.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkSTLWriter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
