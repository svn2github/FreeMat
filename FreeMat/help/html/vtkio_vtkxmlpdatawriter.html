<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkXMLPDataWriter is the superclass for all XML parallel data set
 writers.  It provides functionality needed for writing parallel
 formats, such as the selection of which writer writes the summary
 file and what range of pieces are assigned to each serial writer.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkXMLPDataWriter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkXMLPDataWriter
