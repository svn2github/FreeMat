Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkparallel.html> Visualization Toolkit Parallel Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 This is an abstact class which contains functionality for sending
 and receiving inter-process messages. It contains methods for marshaling
 an object into a string (currently used by the MPI communicator but
 not the shared memory communicator).
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkCommunicator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkCommunicator
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkCommunicator has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkCommunicator class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkCommunicator = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkCommunicator = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetNumberOfProcesses (int num)</code> -  Set the number of processes you will be using.  This defaults
 to the maximum number available.  If you set this to a value
 higher than the default, you will get an error.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetNumberOfProcesses ()</code> -  Set the number of processes you will be using.  This defaults
 to the maximum number available.  If you set this to a value
 higher than the default, you will get an error.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetLocalProcessId ()</code> -  Tells you which process [0, NumProcess) you are in.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.Send (vtkDataObject data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> -  This method sends a data object to a destination.
 Tag eliminates ambiguity
 and is used to match sends to receives.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.Send (vtkDataArray data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> -  This method sends a data array to a destination.
 Tag eliminates ambiguity
 and is used to match sends to receives.

<LI>  <code>int = obj.Receive (vtkDataObject data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> -  This method receives a data object from a corresponding send. It blocks
 until the receive is finished.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkDataObject = obj.ReceiveDataObject (int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> -  The caller does not have to know the data type before this call is made.
 It returns the newly created object.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.Receive (vtkDataArray data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> -  This method receives a data array from a corresponding send. It blocks
 until the receive is finished.
 </LI>

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkIdType = obj.GetCount ()</code> -  Returns the number of words received by the most recent Receive().
 Note that this is not the number of bytes received, but the number of items
 of the data-type received by the most recent Receive() eg. if
 Receive(int*,..) was used, then this returns the number of ints received;
 if Receive(double*,..) was used, then this returns the number of doubles
 received etc. The return value is valid only after a successful Receive().
