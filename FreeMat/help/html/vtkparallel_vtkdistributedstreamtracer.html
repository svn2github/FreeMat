<H3>Usage</H3>
 This filter integrates streamlines on a distributed dataset. It is
 essentially a serial algorithm: only one process is active at one
 time and it is not more efficient than a single process integration.
 It is useful when the data is too large to be on one process and
 has to be kept distributed.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkDistributedStreamTracer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkDistributedStreamTracer
</PRE>
