<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkMultiProcessController is used to control multiple processes
 in a distributed computing environment. It has
 methods for executing single/multiple method(s) on multiple processors,
 triggering registered callbacks (Remote Methods) (AddRMI(), TriggerRMI())
 and communication. Please note that the communication is done using
 the communicator which is accessible to the user. Therefore it is
 possible to get the communicator with GetCommunicator() and use
 it to send and receive data. This is the encouraged communication method.
 The internal (RMI) communications are done using a second internal
 communicator (called RMICommunicator).

To create an instance of class vtkMultiProcessController, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkMultiProcessController has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkMultiProcessController class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkMultiProcessController = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkMultiProcessController = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Finalize ()</code> -  This method is for cleaning up.
 If a subclass needs to clean up process communication (i.e. MPI)
 it would over ride this method.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Finalize (int finalizedExternally)</code> -  This method is for cleaning up.
 If a subclass needs to clean up process communication (i.e. MPI)
 it would over ride this method.  Provided for finalization outside vtk.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetNumberOfProcesses (int num)</code> -  Set the number of processes you will be using.  This defaults
 to the maximum number available.  If you set this to a value
 higher than the default, you will get an error.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetNumberOfProcesses ()</code> -  Set the number of processes you will be using.  This defaults
 to the maximum number available.  If you set this to a value
 higher than the default, you will get an error.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SingleMethodExecute ()</code> -  Execute the SingleMethod (as define by SetSingleMethod) using
 this-&gt;NumberOfProcesses processes.  This will only return when
 all the processes finish executing their methods.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.MultipleMethodExecute ()</code> -  Execute the MultipleMethods (as define by calling SetMultipleMethod
 for each of the required this-&gt;NumberOfProcesses methods) using
 this-&gt;NumberOfProcesses processes.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetLocalProcessId ()</code> -  Tells you which process [0, NumProcess) you are in.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.CreateOutputWindow ()</code> -  This method can be used to tell the controller to create
 a special output window in which all messages are preceded
 by the process id.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkMultiProcessController = obj.CreateSubController (vtkProcessGroup group)</code> -  Creates a new controller with the processes specified by the given group.
 The new controller will already be initialized for you.  You are
 responsible for deleting the controller once you are done.  It is invalid
 to pass this method a group with a different communicator than is used by
 this controller.  This operation is collective accross all processes
 defined in the group.  It is undefined what will happen if the group is not
 the same on all processes.  This method must be called by all processes in
 the controller regardless of whether they are in the group.  NULL is
 returned on all process not in the group.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkMultiProcessController = obj.PartitionController (int localColor, int localKey)</code> -  Partitions this controller based on a coloring.  That is, each process
 passes in a color.  All processes with the same color are grouped into the
 same partition.  The processes are ordered by their self-assigned key.
 Lower keys have lower process ids.  Ties are broken by the current process
 ids.  (For example, if all the keys are 0, then the resulting processes
 will be ordered in the same way.)  This method returns a new controller to
 each process that represents the local partition.  This is basically the
 same operation as MPI_Comm_split.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.TriggerBreakRMIs ()</code> -  A conveniance method.  Called on process 0 to break "ProcessRMIs" loop
 on all other processes.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.TriggerRMI (int remoteProcessId, string arg, int tag)</code> -  Convenience method when there is no argument.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.TriggerRMI (int remoteProcessId, int tag)</code> -  This is a convenicence method to trigger an RMI call on all the "children"
 of the current node. The children of the current node can be determined by
 drawing a binary tree starting at node 0 and then assigned nodes ids
 incrementally in a breadth-first fashion from left to right. This is
 designed to be used when trigger an RMI call on all satellites from the
 root node.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.TriggerRMIOnAllChildren (string arg, int tag)</code> -  This is a convenicence method to trigger an RMI call on all the "children"
 of the current node. The children of the current node can be determined by
 drawing a binary tree starting at node 0 and then assigned nodes ids
 incrementally in a breadth-first fashion from left to right. This is
 designed to be used when trigger an RMI call on all satellites from the
 root node.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.TriggerRMIOnAllChildren (int tag)</code> -  Calling this method gives control to the controller to start
 processing RMIs. Possible return values are:
 RMI_NO_ERROR,
 RMI_TAG_ERROR : rmi tag could not be received,
 RMI_ARG_ERROR : rmi arg could not be received.
 If reportErrors is false, no vtkErrorMacro is called.
 ProcessRMIs() calls ProcessRMIs(int) with reportErrors = 0.
 If dont_loop is 1, this call just process one RMI message
 and exits.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.ProcessRMIs (int reportErrors, int dont_loop)</code> -  Calling this method gives control to the controller to start
 processing RMIs. Possible return values are:

 RMI_TAG_ERROR : rmi tag could not be received,
 RMI_ARG_ERROR : rmi arg could not be received.
 If reportErrors is false, no vtkErrorMacro is called.
 ProcessRMIs() calls ProcessRMIs(int) with reportErrors = 0.
 If dont_loop is 1, this call just process one RMI message
 and exits.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.ProcessRMIs ()</code> -  Calling this method gives control to the controller to start
 processing RMIs. Possible return values are:
 RMI_NO_ERROR,
 RMI_TAG_ERROR : rmi tag could not be received,

 If reportErrors is false, no vtkErrorMacro is called.
 ProcessRMIs() calls ProcessRMIs(int) with reportErrors = 0.
 If dont_loop is 1, this call just process one RMI message
 and exits.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetBreakFlag (int )</code> -  Setting this flag to 1 will cause the ProcessRMIs loop to return.
 This also causes vtkUpStreamPorts to return from
 their WaitForUpdate loops.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetBreakFlag ()</code> -  Setting this flag to 1 will cause the ProcessRMIs loop to return.
 This also causes vtkUpStreamPorts to return from
 their WaitForUpdate loops.

<LI>  <code>int = obj.Reduce (float sendBuffer, float recvBuffer, vtkIdType length, int operation, int destProcessId)</code> -  Reduce an array to the given destination process.  This version of Reduce
