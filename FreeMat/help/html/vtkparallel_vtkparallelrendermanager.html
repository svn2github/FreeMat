<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkparallel.html> Visualization Toolkit Parallel Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkParallelRenderManager operates in multiple processes.  It provides
 proper renderers and render windows for performing the parallel
 rendering correctly.  It can also attach itself to render windows and
 propagate rendering events and camera views.
<P>
 .SECTION Note:
 Many parallel rendering schemes do not correctly handle transparency.
 Unless otherwise documented, assume a sub class does not.
<P>
 .SECTION ToDo:
 Synchronization/barrier primitives.
<P>
 Query ranges of scalar values of objects in addition to the boundry in
 three-space
<P>
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkParallelRenderManager, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkParallelRenderManager
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkParallelRenderManager has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkParallelRenderManager class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkParallelRenderManager = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkParallelRenderManager = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderWindow = obj.MakeRenderWindow ()</code> -  Builds a vtkRenderWindow compatible with this render manager.  The
 user program is responsible for registering the render window with the
 SetRenderWindow method and calling Delete.  It is not advisable to use
 a parallel render manager with a render window that was not built with
 this method.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderer = obj.MakeRenderer ()</code> -  Builds a vtkRenderer compatible with this render manager.  (Should we
 also register it?)  The user program is responsible for calling
 Delete.  It is not advisable to use a parallel render manager with a
 renderer that was not built with this method.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderWindow = obj.GetRenderWindow ()</code> -  Set/Get the RenderWindow to use for compositing.
 We add a start and end observer to the window.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetRenderWindow (vtkRenderWindow renWin)</code> -  Set/Get the RenderWindow to use for compositing.
 We add a start and end observer to the window.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkMultiProcessController = obj.GetController ()</code> -  Set/Get the vtkMultiProcessController which will handle communications
 for the parallel rendering.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetController (vtkMultiProcessController controller)</code> -  Set/Get the vtkMultiProcessController which will handle communications
 for the parallel rendering.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InitializePieces ()</code> -  This method sets the piece and number of pieces for each
 actor with a polydata mapper.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InitializeOffScreen ()</code> -  Make all rendering windows not viewable set as off screen rendering.
 To make all renderwindows on screen rendering again, call
 OffScreenRenderingOff on all the render windows.  This class assumes
 the window on root node is the only one viewable.  Subclasses should
 change this as necessary.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.StartInteractor ()</code> -  Initializes the RMIs and then, if on root node, starts the interactor
 on the attached render window.  Otherwise, starts processing RMIs.
 When the interactor returns, it breaks the RMI listening on all other
 processors.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.StartServices ()</code> -  If on node other than root, starts serving RMI requests for parallel
 renders.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.StopServices ()</code> -  If on root node, stops the RMI processing on all service nodes.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.StartRender ()</code> -  Callbacks that initialize and finish rendering and other tasks.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.EndRender ()</code> -  Callbacks that initialize and finish rendering and other tasks.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SatelliteStartRender ()</code> -  Callbacks that initialize and finish rendering and other tasks.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SatelliteEndRender ()</code> -  Callbacks that initialize and finish rendering and other tasks.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.RenderRMI ()</code> -  Callbacks that initialize and finish rendering and other tasks.
 </LI>

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.InitializeRMIs ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ResetAllCameras ()</code> -  Resets the camera of each renderer contained in the RenderWindow.
 Should only be called in the "root" process, and all remote processes
 must be processing RMIs for this method to complete.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ComputeVisiblePropBounds (vtkRenderer ren, double bounds[6])</code> -  Calculates the bounds by gathering information from all processes.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetParallelRendering (int )</code> -  Turns on/off parallel rendering.  When on (the default) the object
 responds to render events of the attached window, propagates the
 render event to other processors, and otherwise enables the parallel
 rendering process.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetParallelRendering ()</code> -  Turns on/off parallel rendering.  When on (the default) the object
 responds to render events of the attached window, propagates the
 render event to other processors, and otherwise enables the parallel

 render event to other processors, and otherwise enables the parallel
 rendering process.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetRenderEventPropagation (int )</code> -  Turns on/off render event propagation.  When on (the default) and
 ParallelRendering is on, process 0 will send an RMI call to all remote
 processes to perform a synchronized render.  When off, render must be
 manually called on each process.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetRenderEventPropagation ()</code> -  Turns on/off render event propagation.  When on (the default) and
 ParallelRendering is on, process 0 will send an RMI call to all remote
 processes to perform a synchronized render.  When off, render must be
 manually called on each process.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.RenderEventPropagationOn ()</code> -  Turns on/off render event propagation.  When on (the default) and

<LI>  <code>obj.RenderEventPropagationOff ()</code> -  Turns on/off render event propagation.  When on (the default) and
 ParallelRendering is on, process 0 will send an RMI call to all remote
 processes to perform a synchronized render.  When off, render must be
 manually called on each process.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetUseCompositing (int )</code> -  This is used for tiled display rendering.  When data has been
 duplicated on all processes, then we do not need to compositing.
 Cameras and renders are still propagated though.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetUseCompositing ()</code> -  This is used for tiled display rendering.  When data has been
 duplicated on all processes, then we do not need to compositing.

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.UseCompositingOff ()</code> -  This is used for tiled display rendering.  When data has been
 duplicated on all processes, then we do not need to compositing.
 Cameras and renders are still propagated though.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetImageReductionFactor (double factor)</code> -  Set/Get the reduction factor (for sort-last based parallel renderers).
 The size of rendered image is divided by the reduction factor and then
 is blown up to the size of the current vtkRenderWindow.  Setting
 higher reduction factors enables shorter image transfer times (which
 is often the bottleneck) but will greatly reduce image quality.  A
 reduction factor of 2 or greater should only be used for intermediate
 images in interactive applications.  A reduction factor of 1 (or less)
 will result in no change in image quality.  A parallel render manager
 may ignore the image reduction factor if it will result in little or
 no performance enhancements (eg. it does not do image space
 manipulations).
