<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkPExtractArraysOverTime is a parallelized version of
 vtkExtractArraysOverTime. 
 vtkExtractArraysOverTime extract point or cell data given a selection. For
 every cell or point extracted, vtkExtractArraysOverTime create a vtkTable
 that is placed in an appropriately named block in an output multi-block
 dataset. For global-id based selections or location based selections, it's
 possible that over time the cell/point moves across processes. This filter
 ensures that such extractions spread across processes are combined correctly
 into a single vtkTable.
 This filter produces a valid output on the root node alone, all other nodes,
 simply have empty multi-block dataset with number of blocks matching the root
 (to ensure that all processes have the same structure).
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkPExtractArraysOverTime, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkPExtractArraysOverTime
