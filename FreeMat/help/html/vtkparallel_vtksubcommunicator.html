<H3>Usage</H3>
<P>
 This class provides an implementation for communicating on process groups.
 In general, you should never use this class directly.  Instead, use the
 vtkMultiProcessController::CreateSubController method.
<P>
 .SECTION BUGS
<P>
 Because all communication is delegated to the original communicator,
 any error will report process ids with respect to the original
 communicator, not this communicator that was actually used.
<P>
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkSubCommunicator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkSubCommunicator
</PRE>
