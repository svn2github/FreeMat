<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkAbstractPropPicker is an abstract superclass for pickers that can pick
 an instance of vtkProp. Some pickers, like vtkWorldPointPicker (not a
 subclass of this class), cannot identify the prop that is
 picked. Subclasses of vtkAbstractPropPicker return a prop in the form of a
 vtkAssemblyPath when a pick is invoked. Note that an vtkAssemblyPath
 contain a list of vtkAssemblyNodes, each of which in turn contains a
 reference to a vtkProp and a 4x4 transformation matrix. The path fully
 describes the entire pick path, so you can pick assemblies or portions of
 assemblies, or just grab the tail end of the vtkAssemblyPath (which is the
 picked prop).
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkAbstractPropPicker, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkAbstractPropPicker

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkAbstractPropPicker has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkAbstractPropPicker class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkAbstractPropPicker = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkAbstractPropPicker = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetPath (vtkAssemblyPath )</code> -  Return the vtkAssemblyPath that has been picked. The assembly path lists
 all the vtkProps that form an assembly. If no assembly is present, then
 the assembly path will have one node (which is the picked prop). The
 set method is used internally to set the path. (Note: the structure of
 an assembly path is a collection of vtkAssemblyNode, each node pointing
 to a vtkProp and (possibly) a transformation matrix.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkAssemblyPath = obj.GetPath ()</code> -  Return the vtkAssemblyPath that has been picked. The assembly path lists
 all the vtkProps that form an assembly. If no assembly is present, then
 the assembly path will have one node (which is the picked prop). The
 set method is used internally to set the path. (Note: the structure of
 an assembly path is a collection of vtkAssemblyNode, each node pointing
 to a vtkProp and (possibly) a transformation matrix.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkProp = obj.GetViewProp ()</code> -  Return the vtkProp that has been picked. If NULL, nothing was picked.
 If anything at all was picked, this method will return something.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkProp3D = obj.GetProp3D ()</code> -  Return the vtkProp that has been picked. If NULL, no vtkProp3D was picked.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkActor = obj.GetActor ()</code> -  Return the vtkActor that has been picked. If NULL, no actor was picked.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkActor2D = obj.GetActor2D ()</code> -  Return the vtkActor2D that has been picked. If NULL, no actor2D was 
 picked.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkVolume = obj.GetVolume ()</code> -  Return the vtkVolume that has been picked. If NULL, no volume was picked.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkAssembly = obj.GetAssembly ()</code> -  Return the vtkAssembly that has been picked. If NULL, no assembly 
 was picked. (Note: the returned assembly is the first node in the
 assembly path. If the path is one node long, then the assembly and
 the prop are the same, assuming that the first node is a vtkAssembly.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkPropAssembly = obj.GetPropAssembly ()</code> -  Return the vtkPropAssembly that has been picked. If NULL, no prop
 assembly was picked. (Note: the returned prop assembly is the first node
 in the assembly path. If the path is one node long, then the prop
 assembly and the prop are the same, assuming that the first node is a
 vtkPropAssembly.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkProp = obj.GetProp ()</code> -  @deprecated Replaced by vtkAbstractPicker::GetViewProp() as of VTK 5.0.
