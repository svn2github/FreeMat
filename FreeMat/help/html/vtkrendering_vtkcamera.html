<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkCamera is a virtual camera for 3D rendering. It provides methods
 to position and orient the view point and focal point. Convenience 
 methods for moving about the focal point also are provided. More 
 complex methods allow the manipulation of the computer graphics
 model including view up vector, clipping planes, and 
 camera perspective.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkCamera, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkCamera

<LI>  <code>obj.SetUseHorizontalViewAngle (int flag)</code> -  Set/Get the value of the UseHorizontalViewAngle instance variable. If
 set, the camera's view angle represents a horizontal view angle, rather

 keep the perspective transform unchanges.
 </LI>

 set, the camera's view angle represents a horizontal view angle, rather

 camera view measured in degrees.  The default angle is 30 degrees.

 (measured by holding a ruler up to your screen) and d is the
 distance from your eyes to the screen.

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Zoom (double factor)</code> -  In perspective mode, decrease the view angle by the specified factor.
 In parallel mode, decrease the parallel scale by the specified factor.
 A value greater than 1 is a zoom-in, a value less than 1 is a zoom-out.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetClippingRange (double dNear, double dFar)</code> -  Set/Get the location of the near and far clipping planes along the
 direction of projection.  Both of these values must be positive.
 How the clipping planes are set can have a large impact on how

 really could be 1.0 can have a big impact on your z-buffer resolution
 farther away.  The default clipping range is (0.1,1000).

 near clipping plane.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetWindowCenter (double x, double y)</code> -  Set/Get the center of the window in viewport coordinates.

 one large screen.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj. GetWindowCenter ()</code> -  Set/Get the center of the window in viewport coordinates.

 angle (measured from the horizontal) that rays along the direction
 of projection will follow once projected onto the 2D screen.

 the direction of projection.  This creates a shear transform
 x' = x + dz*cos(alpha)/tan(beta), y' = dz*sin(alpha)/tan(beta)
 where dz is the distance of the point from the focal plane.

 the direction of projection, unless you have created an sheared output
 view using SetViewShear/SetObliqueAngles.
 </LI>
