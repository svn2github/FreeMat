<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkGL2PSExporter is a concrete subclass of vtkExporter that writes
 high quality vector PostScript (PS/EPS), PDF or SVG files by using
 GL2PS.  GL2PS can be obtained at: http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/.  This
 can be very useful when one requires publication quality pictures.
 This class works best with simple 3D scenes and most 2D plots.
 Please note that GL2PS has its limitations since PostScript is not
 an ideal language to represent complex 3D scenes.  However, this
 class does allow one to write mixed vector/raster files by using
 the Write3DPropsAsRasterImage ivar.  Please do read the caveats
 section of this documentation.
<P>
 By default vtkGL2PSExporter generates Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
 output along with the text in portrait orientation with the
 background color of the window being drawn.  The generated output
 is also compressed using zlib. The various other options are set to
 sensible defaults.
<P>
 The output file format (FileFormat) can be either PostScript (PS),
 Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), PDF, SVG or TeX.  The file extension
 is generated automatically depending on the FileFormat.  The
 default is EPS.  When TeX output is chosen, only the text strings
 in the plot are generated and put into a picture environment.  One
 can turn on and off the text when generating PS/EPS/PDF/SVG files
 by using the Text boolean variable.  By default the text is drawn.
 The background color of the renderwindow is drawn by default.  To
 make the background white instead use the DrawBackgroundOff
 function.  Landscape figures can be generated by using the
 LandscapeOn function.  Portrait orientation is used by default.
 Several of the GL2PS options can be set.  The names of the ivars
 for these options are similar to the ones that GL2PS provides.
 Compress, SimpleLineOffset, Silent, BestRoot, PS3Shading and
 OcclusionCull are similar to the options provided by GL2PS.  Please
 read the function documentation or the GL2PS documentation for more
 details.  The ivar Write3DPropsAsRasterImage allows one to generate
 mixed vector/raster images.  All the 3D props in the scene will be
 written as a raster image and all 2D actors will be written as
 vector graphic primitives.  This makes it possible to handle
 transparency and complex 3D scenes.  This ivar is set to Off by
 default.  When drawing lines and points the OpenGL point size and
 line width are multiplied by a factor in order to generate
 PostScript lines and points of the right size.  The
 Get/SetGlobalPointSizeFactor and Get/SetGlobalLineWidthFactor let
 one customize this ratio.  The default value is such that the
 PostScript output looks close to what is seen on screen.
<P>
 To use this class you need to turn on VTK_USE_GL2PS when
 configuring VTK.
