In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkImageProcessingPass class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImageProcessingPass = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImageProcessingPass = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow w)</code> -  Release graphics resources and ask components to release their own
 resources.
 \pre w_exists: w!=0
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderPass = obj.GetDelegatePass ()</code> -  Delegate for rendering the image to be processed.
 If it is NULL, nothing will be rendered and a warning will be emitted.
 It is usually set to a vtkCameraPass or to a post-processing pass.
 Initial value is a NULL pointer.
