<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkInteractorObserver is an abstract superclass for subclasses that observe
 events invoked by vtkRenderWindowInteractor. These subclasses are 
 typically things like 3D widgets; objects that interact with actors
 in the scene, or interactively probe the scene for information.
<P>
 vtkInteractorObserver defines the method SetInteractor() and enables and
 disables the processing of events by the vtkInteractorObserver. Use the
 methods EnabledOn() or SetEnabled(1) to turn on the interactor observer,
 and the methods EnabledOff() or SetEnabled(0) to turn off the interactor.
 Initial value is 0.
<P>
 To support interactive manipulation of objects, this class (and
 subclasses) invoke the events StartInteractionEvent, InteractionEvent, and
 EndInteractionEvent.  These events are invoked when the
 vtkInteractorObserver enters a state where rapid response is desired:
 mouse motion, etc. The events can be used, for example, to set the desired
 update frame rate (StartInteractionEvent), operate on data or update a
 pipeline (InteractionEvent), and set the desired frame rate back to normal
 values (EndInteractionEvent). Two other events, EnableEvent and
 DisableEvent, are invoked when the interactor observer is enabled or
 disabled.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkInteractorObserver, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkInteractorObserver
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkInteractorObserver has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkInteractorObserver class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkInteractorObserver = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkInteractorObserver = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetEnabled (int )</code> -  Methods for turning the interactor observer on and off, and determining
 its state. All subclasses must provide the SetEnabled() method.
 Enabling a vtkInteractorObserver has the side effect of adding
 observers; disabling it removes the observers. Prior to enabling the
 vtkInteractorObserver you must set the render window interactor (via
 SetInteractor()). Initial value is 0.

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Off ()</code> -  This method is used to associate the widget with the render window
 interactor.  Observers of the appropriate events invoked in the render
 window interactor are set up as a result of this method invocation.
 The SetInteractor() method must be invoked prior to enabling the
 vtkInteractorObserver.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetInteractor (vtkRenderWindowInteractor iren)</code> -  This method is used to associate the widget with the render window
 interactor.  Observers of the appropriate events invoked in the render
 window interactor are set up as a result of this method invocation.
 The SetInteractor() method must be invoked prior to enabling the
 vtkInteractorObserver.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderWindowInteractor = obj.GetInteractor ()</code> -  This method is used to associate the widget with the render window
 interactor.  Observers of the appropriate events invoked in the render
 window interactor are set up as a result of this method invocation.
 The SetInteractor() method must be invoked prior to enabling the
 vtkInteractorObserver.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetPriority (float )</code> -  Set/Get the priority at which events are processed. This is used when
 multiple interactor observers are used simultaneously. The default value
 is 0.0 (lowest priority.) Note that when multiple interactor observer
 have the same priority, then the last observer added will process the
 event first. (Note: once the SetInteractor() method has been called,
 changing the priority does not effect event processing. You will have
 to SetInteractor(NULL), change priority, and then SetInteractor(iren)
 to have the priority take effect.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>float = obj.GetPriorityMinValue ()</code> -  Set/Get the priority at which events are processed. This is used when
 multiple interactor observers are used simultaneously. The default value
 is 0.0 (lowest priority.) Note that when multiple interactor observer
 have the same priority, then the last observer added will process the
 event first. (Note: once the SetInteractor() method has been called,
 changing the priority does not effect event processing. You will have
 to SetInteractor(NULL), change priority, and then SetInteractor(iren)
 to have the priority take effect.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>float = obj.GetPriorityMaxValue ()</code> -  Set/Get the priority at which events are processed. This is used when
 multiple interactor observers are used simultaneously. The default value
 is 0.0 (lowest priority.) Note that when multiple interactor observer
 have the same priority, then the last observer added will process the
 event first. (Note: once the SetInteractor() method has been called,
 changing the priority does not effect event processing. You will have
 to SetInteractor(NULL), change priority, and then SetInteractor(iren)
 to have the priority take effect.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>float = obj.GetPriority ()</code> -  Set/Get the priority at which events are processed. This is used when
 multiple interactor observers are used simultaneously. The default value
 is 0.0 (lowest priority.) Note that when multiple interactor observer
 have the same priority, then the last observer added will process the
 event first. (Note: once the SetInteractor() method has been called,
 changing the priority does not effect event processing. You will have
 to SetInteractor(NULL), change priority, and then SetInteractor(iren)
 to have the priority take effect.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetKeyPressActivation (int )</code> -  Enable/Disable of the use of a keypress to turn on and off the
 interactor observer. (By default, the keypress is 'i' for "interactor
 observer".)  Set the KeyPressActivationValue to change which key
 activates the widget.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetKeyPressActivation ()</code> -  Enable/Disable of the use of a keypress to turn on and off the
 interactor observer. (By default, the keypress is 'i' for "interactor
 observer".)  Set the KeyPressActivationValue to change which key
 activates the widget.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.KeyPressActivationOn ()</code> -  Enable/Disable of the use of a keypress to turn on and off the
 interactor observer. (By default, the keypress is 'i' for "interactor
 observer".)  Set the KeyPressActivationValue to change which key
 activates the widget.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.KeyPressActivationOff ()</code> -  Enable/Disable of the use of a keypress to turn on and off the
 interactor observer. (By default, the keypress is 'i' for "interactor
 observer".)  Set the KeyPressActivationValue to change which key
 activates the widget.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetKeyPressActivationValue (char )</code> -  Specify which key press value to use to activate the interactor observer
 (if key press activation is enabled). By default, the key press
 activation value is 'i'. Note: once the SetInteractor() method is
 invoked, changing the key press activation value will not affect the key
 press until SetInteractor(NULL)/SetInteractor(iren) is called.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>char = obj.GetKeyPressActivationValue ()</code> -  Specify which key press value to use to activate the interactor observer
 (if key press activation is enabled). By default, the key press
 activation value is 'i'. Note: once the SetInteractor() method is
 invoked, changing the key press activation value will not affect the key
 press until SetInteractor(NULL)/SetInteractor(iren) is called.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderer = obj.GetDefaultRenderer ()</code> -  Set/Get the default renderer to use when activating the interactor 
 observer. Normally when the widget is activated (SetEnabled(1) or when 
 keypress activation takes place), the renderer over which the mouse
 pointer is positioned is used. Alternatively, you can specify the
 renderer to bind the interactor to when the interactor observer is
 activated. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetDefaultRenderer (vtkRenderer )</code> -  Set/Get the default renderer to use when activating the interactor 
 observer. Normally when the widget is activated (SetEnabled(1) or when 
 keypress activation takes place), the renderer over which the mouse
 pointer is positioned is used. Alternatively, you can specify the
 renderer to bind the interactor to when the interactor observer is
 activated. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderer = obj.GetCurrentRenderer ()</code> -  Set/Get the current renderer. Normally when the widget is activated 
 (SetEnabled(1) or when keypress activation takes place), the renderer
 over which the mouse pointer is positioned is used and assigned to
 this Ivar. Alternatively, you might want to set the CurrentRenderer
 explicitly.
 WARNING: note that if the DefaultRenderer Ivar is set (see above), 
 it will always override the parameter passed to SetCurrentRenderer,
 unless it is NULL.
 (i.e., SetCurrentRenderer(foo) = SetCurrentRenderer(DefaultRenderer).
