<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkLeaderActor2D creates a leader with an optional label and arrows. (A
 leader is typically used to indicate distance between points.)
 vtkLeaderActor2D is a type of vtkActor2D; that is, it is drawn on the
 overlay plane and is not occluded by 3D geometry. To use this class, you
 typically specify two points defining the start and end points of the line
 (x-y definition using vtkCoordinate class), whether to place arrows on one
 or both end points, and whether to label the leader. Also, this class has a
 special feature that allows curved leaders to be created by specifying a
 radius.
<P>
 Use the vtkLeaderActor2D uses its superclass vtkActor2D instance variables
 Position and Position2 vtkCoordinates to place an instance of
 vtkLeaderActor2D (i.e., these two data members represent the start and end
 points of the leader).  Using these vtkCoordinates you can specify the position
 of the leader in a variety of coordinate systems. 
<P>
 To control the appearance of the actor, use the superclasses
 vtkActor2D::vtkProperty2D and the vtkTextProperty objects associated with
 this actor.
<P>
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkLeaderActor2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkLeaderActor2D

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkLeaderActor2D has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkLeaderActor2D class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkLeaderActor2D = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkLeaderActor2D = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetRadius (double )</code> -  Set/Get a radius which can be used to curve the leader.  If a radius is
 specified whose absolute value is greater than one half the distance
 between the two points defined by the superclasses' Position and
 Position2 ivars, then the leader will be curved. A positive radius will
 produce a curve such that the center is to the right of the line from
 Position and Position2; a negative radius will produce a curve in the 
 opposite sense. By default, the radius is set to zero and thus there
 is no curvature. Note that the radius is expresses as a multiple of
 the distance between (Position,Position2); this avoids issues relative
 to coordinate system transformations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetRadius ()</code> -  Set/Get a radius which can be used to curve the leader.  If a radius is
 specified whose absolute value is greater than one half the distance
 between the two points defined by the superclasses' Position and
 Position2 ivars, then the leader will be curved. A positive radius will
 produce a curve such that the center is to the right of the line from
 Position and Position2; a negative radius will produce a curve in the 
 opposite sense. By default, the radius is set to zero and thus there
 is no curvature. Note that the radius is expresses as a multiple of
 the distance between (Position,Position2); this avoids issues relative
 to coordinate system transformations.
