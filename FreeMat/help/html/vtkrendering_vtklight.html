<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkLight is a virtual light for 3D rendering. It provides methods to locate
 and point the light, turn it on and off, and set its brightness and color.
 In addition to the basic infinite distance point light source attributes,
 you also can specify the light attenuation values and cone angle.
 These attributes are only used if the light is a positional light.
 The default is a directional light (e.g. infinite point light source).
<P>
 Lights have a type that describes how the light should move with respect
 to the camera.  A Headlight is always located at the current camera position
 and shines on the camera's focal point.  A CameraLight also moves with
 the camera, but may not be coincident to it.  CameraLights are defined
 in a normalized coordinate space where the camera is located at (0, 0, 1),
 the camera is looking at (0, 0, 0), and up is (0, 1, 0).  Finally, a 
 SceneLight is part of the scene itself and does not move with the camera.
 (Renderers are responsible for moving the light based on its type.)
<P>
 Lights have a transformation matrix that describes the space in which
 they are positioned.  A light's world space position and focal point
 are defined by their local position and focal point, transformed by
 their transformation matrix (if it exists).

To create an instance of class vtkLight, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

  obj = vtkLight

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkLight has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkLight class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>

 A SceneLight is a light located in the world coordinate space.  A light
 is initially created as a scene light.

 A Headlight is always located at the camera and is pointed at the 
 camera's focal point.  The renderer is free to modify the position and
 focal point of the camera at any time.

 A CameraLight is also attached to the camera, but is not necessarily
 located at the camera's position.  CameraLights are defined in a 
 coordinate space where the camera is located at (0, 0, 1), looking
 towards (0, 0, 0) at a distance of 1, with up being (0, 1, 0).

 Note: Use SetLightTypeToSceneLight, rather than SetLightType(3), since
 the former clears the light's transform matrix.
