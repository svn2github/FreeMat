<H3>Usage</H3>
  This class resorts to GLSL to implement GPU-based Line Integral Convolution 
  (LIC) for visualizing a 2D vector field that may be obtained by projecting
  an original 3D vector field onto a surface (such that the resulting 2D 
  vector at each grid point on the surface is tangential to the local normal,
  as done in vtkSurfaceLICPainter). 
  
  As an image-based technique, 2D LIC works by (1) integrating a bidirectional
  streamline from the center of each pixel (of the LIC output image), (2)
  locating the pixels along / hit by this streamline as the correlated pixels
  of the starting pixel (seed point / pixel), (3) indexing a (usually white) 
  noise texture (another input to LIC, in addition to the 2D vector field, 
  usually with the same size as that of the 2D vetor field) to determine the
  values (colors) of these pixels (the starting and the correlated pixels), 
  typically through bi-linear interpolation, and (4) performing convolution
  (weighted averaging) on these values, by adopting a low-pass filter (such 
  as box, ramp, and Hanning kernels), to obtain the result value (color) that
  is then assigned to the seed pixel.
<P>
  The GLSL-based GPU implementation herein maps the aforementioned pipeline to
  fragment shaders and a box kernel is employed. Both the white noise and the
  vector field are provided to the GPU as texture objects (supported by the 
  multi-texturing capability). In addition, there are four texture objects 
  (color buffers) allocated to constitute two pairs that work in a ping-pong
  fashion, with one as the read buffers and the other as the write / render 
  targets. Maintained by a frame buffer object (GL_EXT_framebuffer_object),
  each pair employs one buffer to store the current (dynamically updated)
  position (by means of the texture coordinate that keeps being warped by the
  underlying vector) of the (virtual) particle initially released from each 
  fragment while using the bother buffer to store the current (dynamically
  updated too) accumulated texture value that each seed fragment (before the
  'mesh' is warped) collects. Given NumberOfSteps integration steps in each
  direction, there are a total of (2 * NumberOfSteps + 1) fragments (including
  the seed fragment) are convolved and each contributes 1 / (2 * NumberOfSteps
  + 1) of the associated texture value to fulfill the box filter.
  
  One pass of LIC (basic LIC) tends to produce low-contrast / blurred images and
  vtkLineIntegralConvolution2D provides an option for creating enhanced LIC
  images. Enhanced LIC improves image quality by increasing inter-streamline
  contrast while suppressing artifacts. It performs two passes of LIC, with a
  3x3 Laplacian high-pass filter in between that processes the output of pass
  #1 LIC and forwards the result as the input 'noise' to pass #2 LIC. Enhanced
  LIC automatically degenerates to basic LIC during user interaction.
<P>
  vtkLineIntegralConvolution2D applies masking to zero-vector fragments so
  that un-filtered white noise areas are made totally transparent by class
  vtkSurfaceLICPainter to show the underlying geometry surface.
