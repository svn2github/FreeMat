<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper2D provides 2D PolyData annotation support for 
 vtk under OpenGL.  Normally the user should use vtkPolyDataMapper2D 
 which in turn will use this class.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper2D
</PRE>

In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper2D class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper2D = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper2D = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.RenderOverlay (vtkViewport viewport, vtkActor2D actor)</code> -  Actually draw the poly data.
