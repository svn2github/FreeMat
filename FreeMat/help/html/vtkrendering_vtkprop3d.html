<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkProp3D is an abstract class used to represent an entity in a rendering
 scene (i.e., vtkProp3D is a vtkProp with an associated transformation
 matrix).  It handles functions related to the position, orientation and
 scaling. It combines these instance variables into one 4x4 transformation
 matrix as follows: [x y z 1] = [x y z 1] Translate(-origin) Scale(scale)
 Rot(y) Rot(x) Rot (z) Trans(origin) Trans(position). Both vtkActor and
 vtkVolume are specializations of class vtkProp.  The constructor defaults
 to: origin(0,0,0) position=(0,0,0) orientation=(0,0,0), no user defined 
 matrix or transform, and no texture map.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkProp3D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkProp3D

<LI>  <code>obj.SetUserTransform (vtkLinearTransform transform)</code> -  In addition to the instance variables such as position and orientation,

 transformation is concatenated with the actor's internal transformation,
 which you implicitly create through the use of SetPosition(),
 SetOrigin() and SetOrientation().
 &lt;p&gt;If the internal transformation
 is identity (i.e. if you don't set the Position, Origin, or
 Orientation) then the actors final transformation will be the
 UserTransform, concatenated with the UserMatrix if the UserMatrix
 is present.

 you can add an additional transformation for your own use.  This
 transformation is concatenated with the actor's internal transformation,
 which you implicitly create through the use of SetPosition(),
 SetOrigin() and SetOrientation().
 &lt;p&gt;If the internal transformation
 is identity (i.e. if you don't set the Position, Origin, or
 Orientation) then the actors final transformation will be the
 UserTransform, concatenated with the UserMatrix if the UserMatrix
 is present.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetUserMatrix (vtkMatrix4x4 matrix)</code> -  The UserMatrix can be used in place of UserTransform.

 others in the current transformation matrix.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.RotateY (double )</code> -  Rotate the Prop3D in degrees about the Y axis using the right hand
 rule. The axis is the Prop3D's Y axis, which can change as other

 state is set to the matrix specified. The method does this by
 setting appropriate transformation-related ivars to initial
 values (i.e., not transformed), and placing the user-supplied
 matrix into the UserMatrix of this vtkProp3D. If the method is
 called again with a NULL matrix, then the original state of the
 vtkProp3D will be restored. This method is used to support
 picking and assembly structures.
