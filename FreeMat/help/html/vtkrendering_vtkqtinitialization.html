<H3>Usage</H3>
 Utility class that initializes Qt by creating an instance of 
 QApplication in its ctor, if one doesn't already exist.
 This is mainly of use in ParaView with filters that use Qt in
 their implementation - create an instance of vtkQtInitialization
 prior to instantiating any filters that require Qt.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkQtInitialization, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkQtInitialization
</PRE>
