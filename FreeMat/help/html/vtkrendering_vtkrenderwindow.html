<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkRenderWindow is an abstract object to specify the behavior of a
 rendering window. A rendering window is a window in a graphical user
 interface where renderers draw their images. Methods are provided to
 synchronize the rendering process, set window size, and control double
 buffering.  The window also allows rendering in stereo.  The interlaced
 render stereo type is for output to a VRex stereo projector.  All of the
 odd horizontal lines are from the left eye, and the even lines are from
 the right eye.  The user has to make the render window aligned with the
 VRex projector, or the eye will be swapped.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkRenderWindow, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkRenderWindow

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkRenderWindow has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.

 front argument indicates if the front buffer should be used or the back
 buffer. It is the caller's responsibility to delete the resulting
 array. It is very important to realize that the memory in this array
 is organized from the bottom of the window to the top. The origin
 of the screen is in the lower left corner. The y axis increases as
 you go up the screen. So the storage of pixels is from left to right
 and from bottom to top.

 or completely replaces the frame buffer data.

 Depending on how your scene is organized you can get away with as

 One thing to note is that if you are using focal depth frames,
 then you will not need many (if any) frames for antialiasing.
 </LI>

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetSubFrames ()</code> -  Set the number of sub frames for doing motion blur. The default is zero.
 Once this is set greater than one, you will no longer see a new frame
 for every Render().  If you set this to five, you will need to do
 five Render() invocations before seeing the result. This isn't
 very impressive unless something is changing between the Renders.
 Changing this value may reset the current subframe count.

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ClearInRenderStatus ()</code> -  Set/Get the desired update rate. This is used with

 all the time they want to.

<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetNumberOfLayersMinValue ()</code> -  Get the number of layers for renderers.  Each renderer should have
 its layer set individually.  Some algorithms iterate through all layers,
 so it is not wise to set the number of layers to be exorbitantly large
 (say bigger than 100).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetNumberOfLayersMaxValue ()</code> -  Get the number of layers for renderers.  Each renderer should have
 its layer set individually.  Some algorithms iterate through all layers,
 so it is not wise to set the number of layers to be exorbitantly large
 (say bigger than 100).
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderWindowInteractor = obj.GetInteractor ()</code> -  Get the interactor associated with this render window
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetInteractor (vtkRenderWindowInteractor )</code> -  Set the interactor to the render window
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.UnRegister (vtkObjectBase o)</code> -  This Method detects loops of RenderWindow&lt;-&gt;Interactor,
 so objects are freed properly.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetWindowInfo (string )</code> -  Dummy stubs for vtkWindow API.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetNextWindowInfo (string )</code> -  Dummy stubs for vtkWindow API.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetParentInfo (string )</code> -  Dummy stubs for vtkWindow API.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.MakeCurrent ()</code> -  Attempt to make this window the current graphics context for the calling
 thread.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>bool = obj.IsCurrent ()</code> -  Tells if this window is the current graphics context for the calling
 thread.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetForceMakeCurrent ()</code> -  If called, allow MakeCurrent() to skip cache-check when called.
 MakeCurrent() reverts to original behavior of cache-checking
 on the next render.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.ReportCapabilities ()</code> -  Get report of capabilities for the render window
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.SupportsOpenGL ()</code> -  Does this render window support OpenGL? 0-false, 1-true
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsDirect ()</code> -  Is this render window using hardware acceleration? 0-false, 1-true
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetDepthBufferSize ()</code> -  This method should be defined by the subclass. How many bits of
 precision are there in the zbuffer?
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetColorBufferSizes (int rgba)</code> -  Get the size of the color buffer.
 Returns 0 if not able to determine otherwise sets R G B and A into buffer.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkPainterDeviceAdapter = obj.GetPainterDeviceAdapter ()</code> -  Get the vtkPainterDeviceAdapter which can be used to paint on
 this render window.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetMultiSamples (int )</code> -  Set / Get the number of multisamples to use for hardware antialiasing.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetMultiSamples ()</code> -  Set / Get the number of multisamples to use for hardware antialiasing.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetStencilCapable (int )</code> -  Set / Get the availability of the stencil buffer.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetStencilCapable ()</code> -  Set / Get the availability of the stencil buffer.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.StencilCapableOn ()</code> -  Set / Get the availability of the stencil buffer.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.StencilCapableOff ()</code> -  Set / Get the availability of the stencil buffer.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetReportGraphicErrors (int )</code> -  Turn on/off report of graphic errors. Initial value is false (off).
 This flag is used by vtkGraphicErrorMacro.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetReportGraphicErrors ()</code> -  Turn on/off report of graphic errors. Initial value is false (off).
 This flag is used by vtkGraphicErrorMacro.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ReportGraphicErrorsOn ()</code> -  Turn on/off report of graphic errors. Initial value is false (off).
 This flag is used by vtkGraphicErrorMacro.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ReportGraphicErrorsOff ()</code> -  Turn on/off report of graphic errors. Initial value is false (off).
 This flag is used by vtkGraphicErrorMacro.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.CheckGraphicError ()</code> -  Update graphic error status, regardless of ReportGraphicErrors flag.
 It means this method can be used in any context and is not restricted to
 debug mode.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.HasGraphicError ()</code> -  Return the last graphic error status. Initial value is false.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetLastGraphicErrorString ()</code> -  Return a string matching the last graphic error status.
