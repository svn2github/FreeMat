<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkrendering.html> Visualization Toolkit Rendering Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkRenderWindowInteractor provides a platform-independent interaction
 mechanism for mouse/key/time events. It serves as a base class for
 platform-dependent implementations that handle routing of mouse/key/timer
 messages to vtkInteractorObserver and its subclasses. vtkRenderWindowInteractor 
 also provides controls for picking, rendering frame rate, and headlights.
<P>
 vtkRenderWindowInteractor has changed from previous implementations and
 now serves only as a shell to hold user preferences and route messages to
 vtkInteractorStyle. Callbacks are available for many events.  Platform
 specific subclasses should provide methods for manipulating timers,
 TerminateApp, and an event loop if required via
 Initialize/Start/Enable/Disable.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkRenderWindowInteractor, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkRenderWindowInteractor
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkRenderWindowInteractor has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkRenderWindowInteractor class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderWindowInteractor = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderWindowInteractor = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Initialize ()</code> -  Prepare for handling events. This must be called before the
 interactor will work.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ReInitialize ()</code> -  This Method detects loops of RenderWindow-Interactor,
 so objects are freed properly.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.UnRegister (vtkObjectBase o)</code> -  This Method detects loops of RenderWindow-Interactor,
 so objects are freed properly.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Start ()</code> -  Enable/Disable interactions.  By default interactors are enabled when
 initialized.  Initialize() must be called prior to enabling/disabling
 interaction. These methods are used when a window/widget is being
 shared by multiple renderers and interactors.  This allows a "modal"
 display where one interactor is active when its data is to be displayed
 and all other interactors associated with the widget are disabled
 when their data is not displayed.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Enable ()</code> -  Enable/Disable interactions.  By default interactors are enabled when
 initialized.  Initialize() must be called prior to enabling/disabling
 interaction. These methods are used when a window/widget is being
 shared by multiple renderers and interactors.  This allows a "modal"
 display where one interactor is active when its data is to be displayed
 and all other interactors associated with the widget are disabled
 when their data is not displayed.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Disable ()</code> -  Enable/Disable interactions.  By default interactors are enabled when
 initialized.  Initialize() must be called prior to enabling/disabling
 interaction. These methods are used when a window/widget is being
 shared by multiple renderers and interactors.  This allows a "modal"
 display where one interactor is active when its data is to be displayed
 and all other interactors associated with the widget are disabled
 when their data is not displayed.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetEnabled ()</code> -  Enable/Disable interactions.  By default interactors are enabled when
 initialized.  Initialize() must be called prior to enabling/disabling
 interaction. These methods are used when a window/widget is being
 shared by multiple renderers and interactors.  This allows a "modal"
 display where one interactor is active when its data is to be displayed
 and all other interactors associated with the widget are disabled
 when their data is not displayed.

<LI>  <code>obj.EnableRenderOn ()</code> -  Enable/Disable whether vtkRenderWindowInteractor::Render() calls
 this-&gt;RenderWindow-&gt;Render().

 this-&gt;RenderWindow-&gt;Render().

 Window size is measured in pixels.

<LI>  <code>int = obj.CreateTimer (int timerType)</code> -  This class provides two groups of methods for manipulating timers.  The
 first group (CreateTimer(timerType) and DestroyTimer()) implicitly use
 an internal timer id (and are present for backward compatibility). The
 second group (CreateRepeatingTimer(long),CreateOneShotTimer(long),
 ResetTimer(int),DestroyTimer(int)) use timer ids so multiple timers can
 be independently managed. In the first group, the CreateTimer() method
 takes an argument indicating whether the timer is created the first time
 (timerType==VTKI_TIMER_FIRST) or whether it is being reset
 (timerType==VTKI_TIMER_UPDATE). (In initial implementations of VTK this
 was how one shot and repeating timers were managed.) In the second
 group, the create methods take a timer duration argument (in
 milliseconds) and return a timer id. Thus the ResetTimer(timerId) and
 DestroyTimer(timerId) methods take this timer id and operate on the
 timer as appropriate. Methods are also available for determining

 contending for resources. Multiple interactor observers will often
 request different resources (e.g., cursor shape); the mediator uses a

 the particular request (default versus non-default cursor shape).
