<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkTDxInteractorStyle is an abstract class defining an event-driven
 interface to support 3DConnexion device events send by
 vtkRenderWindowInteractor.
 vtkRenderWindowInteractor forwards events in a platform independent form to
 vtkInteractorStyle which can then delegate some processing to
 vtkTDxInteractorStyle.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkTDxInteractorStyle, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkTDxInteractorStyle

In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkTDxInteractorStyle class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTDxInteractorStyle = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTDxInteractorStyle = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTDxInteractorStyleSettings = obj.GetSettings ()</code> -  3Dconnexion device settings. (sensitivity, individual axis filters).
 Initial object is not null.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetSettings (vtkTDxInteractorStyleSettings settings)</code> -  3Dconnexion device settings. (sensitivity, individual axis filters).
 Initial object is not null.
