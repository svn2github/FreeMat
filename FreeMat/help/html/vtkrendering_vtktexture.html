<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkTexture is an object that handles loading and binding of texture
 maps. It obtains its data from an input image data dataset type.
 Thus you can create visualization pipelines to read, process, and 
 construct textures. Note that textures will only work if texture
 coordinates are also defined, and if the rendering system supports 
 texture.
<P>
 Instances of vtkTexture are associated with actors via the actor's
 SetTexture() method. Actors can share texture maps (this is encouraged
 to save memory resources.) 
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkTexture, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkTexture
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkTexture has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkTexture class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTexture = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTexture = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Render (vtkRenderer ren)</code> -  Renders a texture map. It first checks the object's modified time
 to make sure the texture maps Input is valid, then it invokes the 
 Load() method.

 graphics context.

 The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
 resources to release.
 </LI>

 vtkTexture will load its data into graphics system in response 
 to this method invocation.
