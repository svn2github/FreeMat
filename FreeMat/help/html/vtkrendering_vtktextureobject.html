<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkTextureObject represents an OpenGL texture object. It provides API to
 create textures using data already loaded into pixel buffer objects. It can
 also be used to create textures without uploading any data.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkTextureObject, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkTextureObject
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkTextureObject has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkTextureObject class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkTextureObject = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetContext (vtkRenderWindow )</code> -  Get/Set the context. This does not increase the reference count of the 
 context to avoid reference loops.
 SetContext() may raise an error is the OpenGL context does not support the
 required OpenGL extensions.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkRenderWindow = obj.GetContext ()</code> -  Get/Set the context. This does not increase the reference count of the 
 context to avoid reference loops.
 SetContext() may raise an error is the OpenGL context does not support the
 required OpenGL extensions.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetWidth ()</code> -  Get the texture dimensions.
 These are the properties of the OpenGL texture this instance represents.

<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetHeight ()</code> -  Get the texture dimensions.
 These are the properties of the OpenGL texture this instance represents.

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetHandle ()</code> -  Returns the OpenGL handle.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.Bind ()</code> -  Activate the texture. The texture must have been created using Create().
 RenderWindow must be set before calling this. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.UnBind ()</code> -  Activate the texture. The texture must have been created using Create().
 RenderWindow must be set before calling this. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>bool = obj.IsBound ()</code> -  Tells if the texture object is bound to the active texture image unit.

 implementation supporting sampler with integer values.
 Even if the card supports texture int, it does not mean that
 the implementor of the shader made a version that supports texture int.

 at location (dstXmin,dstYmin). (dstXmin,dstYmin) is the location of the

 - texture coordinates are sent on texture coordinate processing unit 0.
 - if the fixed-pipeline fragment shader is used, texturing has to be set
 on texture image unit 0 and the texture object has to be bound on texture
 image unit 0.
 - if a customized fragment shader is used, you are free to pick the
 texture image unit you want. You can even have multiple texture objects
 attached on multiple texture image units. In this case, you call this
 method only on one of them.

 lower left corner of the rectangle in the texture. width and height
 specifies the size of the rectangle in pixels.
 If the logical buffer is a color buffer, it has to be selected first with
 glReadBuffer().
