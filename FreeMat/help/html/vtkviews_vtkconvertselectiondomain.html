<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkConvertSelectionDomain converts a selection from one domain to another
 using known domain mappings. The domain mappings are described by a
 vtkMultiBlockDataSet containing one or more vtkTables.
<P>
 The first input port is for the input selection (or collection of annotations
 in a vtkAnnotationLayers object), while the second port
 is for the multi-block of mappings, and the third port is for the
 data that is being selected on.
<P>
 If the second or third port is not set, this filter will pass the
 selection/annotation to the output unchanged.
<P>
 The second output is the selection associated with the "current annotation"
 normally representing the current interactive selection.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkConvertSelectionDomain, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkConvertSelectionDomain
