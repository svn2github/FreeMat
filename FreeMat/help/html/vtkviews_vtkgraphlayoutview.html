<H3>Usage</H3>
 vtkGraphLayoutView performs graph layout and displays a vtkGraph.
 You may color and label the vertices and edges using fields in the graph.
 If coordinates are already assigned to the graph vertices in your graph,
 set the layout strategy to PassThrough in this view. The default layout
 is Fast2D which is fast but not that good, for better layout set the
 layout to Simple2D or ForceDirected. There are also tree and circle
 layout strategies. :)

<LI>  <code>bool = obj.GetVertexScalarBarVisibility ()</code> -  Whether the scalar bar for vertices is visible.  Default is off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.ZoomToSelection ()</code> -  Reset the camera based on the bounds of the selected region.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsLayoutComplete ()</code> -  Is the graph layout complete? This method is useful
 for when the strategy is iterative and the application
 wants to show the iterative progress of the graph layout
 See Also: UpdateLayout();
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.UpdateLayout ()</code> -  This method is useful for when the strategy is iterative 
 and the application wants to show the iterative progress 
 of the graph layout. The application would have something like
 while(!IsLayoutComplete())
   {
   UpdateLayout();
   }
