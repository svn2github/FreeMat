<P>
Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkvolumerendering.html> Visualization Toolkit Volume Rendering Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 This is a volume mapper for unstructured grid implemented with the ZSweep
 algorithm. This is a software projective method.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper class.

 </LI>
<LI>  <code>float = obj.GetImageSampleDistanceMaxValue ()</code> -  Sampling distance in the XY image dimensions. Default value of 1 meaning
 1 ray cast per pixel. If set to 0.5, 4 rays will be cast per pixel. If
 set to 2.0, 1 ray will be cast for every 4 (2 by 2) pixels.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>float = obj.GetImageSampleDistance ()</code> -  Sampling distance in the XY image dimensions. Default value of 1 meaning
 1 ray cast per pixel. If set to 0.5, 4 rays will be cast per pixel. If
 set to 2.0, 1 ray will be cast for every 4 (2 by 2) pixels.
