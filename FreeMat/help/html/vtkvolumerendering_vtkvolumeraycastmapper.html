Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkvolumerendering.html> Visualization Toolkit Volume Rendering Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 This is a software ray caster for rendering volumes in vtkImageData. 
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkVolumeRayCastMapper, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkVolumeRayCastMapper

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkVolumeRayCastMapper has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkVolumeRayCastMapper class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkVolumeRayCastMapper = obj.NewInstance ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkVolumeRayCastMapper = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetSampleDistance (double )</code> -  Set/Get the distance between samples.  This variable is only
 used for sampling ray casting methods.  Methods that compute
 a ray value by stepping cell-by-cell are not affected by this
 value. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetSampleDistance ()</code> -  Set/Get the distance between samples.  This variable is only
 used for sampling ray casting methods.  Methods that compute
 a ray value by stepping cell-by-cell are not affected by this
 value. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetVolumeRayCastFunction (vtkVolumeRayCastFunction )</code> -  Get / Set the volume ray cast function. This is used to process
 values found along the ray to compute a final pixel value.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkVolumeRayCastFunction = obj.GetVolumeRayCastFunction ()</code> -  Get / Set the volume ray cast function. This is used to process
 values found along the ray to compute a final pixel value.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetGradientEstimator (vtkEncodedGradientEstimator gradest)</code> -  Set / Get the gradient estimator used to estimate normals
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkEncodedGradientEstimator = obj.GetGradientEstimator ()</code> -  Set / Get the gradient estimator used to estimate normals
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkEncodedGradientShader = obj.GetGradientShader ()</code> -  Get the gradient shader.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetImageSampleDistance (double )</code> -  Sampling distance in the XY image dimensions. Default value of 1 meaning
 1 ray cast per pixel. If set to 0.5, 4 rays will be cast per pixel. If
 set to 2.0, 1 ray will be cast for every 4 (2 by 2) pixels.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetImageSampleDistanceMinValue ()</code> -  Sampling distance in the XY image dimensions. Default value of 1 meaning
 1 ray cast per pixel. If set to 0.5, 4 rays will be cast per pixel. If
 set to 2.0, 1 ray will be cast for every 4 (2 by 2) pixels.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetImageSampleDistanceMaxValue ()</code> -  Sampling distance in the XY image dimensions. Default value of 1 meaning
 1 ray cast per pixel. If set to 0.5, 4 rays will be cast per pixel. If
 set to 2.0, 1 ray will be cast for every 4 (2 by 2) pixels.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetImageSampleDistance ()</code> -  Sampling distance in the XY image dimensions. Default value of 1 meaning
 1 ray cast per pixel. If set to 0.5, 4 rays will be cast per pixel. If
 set to 2.0, 1 ray will be cast for every 4 (2 by 2) pixels.
