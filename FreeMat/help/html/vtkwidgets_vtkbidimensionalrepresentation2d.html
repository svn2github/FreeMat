<H3>Usage</H3>
 The vtkBiDimensionalRepresentation2D is used to represent the
 bi-dimensional measure in a 2D (overlay) context. This representation
 consists of two perpendicular lines defined by four
 vtkHandleRepresentations. The four handles can be independently
 manipulated consistent with the orthogonal constraint on the lines. (Note:
 the four points are referred to as Point1, Point2, Point3 and
 Point4. Point1 and Point2 define the first line; and Point3 and Point4
 define the second orthogonal line.)
<P>
 To create this widget, you click to place the first two points. The third
 point is mirrored with the fourth point; when you place the third point
 (which is orthogonal to the lined defined by the first two points), the
 fourth point is dropped as well. After definition, the four points can be
 moved (in constrained fashion, preserving orthogonality). Further, the
 entire widget can be translated by grabbing the center point of the widget;
 each line can be moved along the other line; and the entire widget can be
 rotated around its center point.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkBiDimensionalRepresentation2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkBiDimensionalRepresentation2D
