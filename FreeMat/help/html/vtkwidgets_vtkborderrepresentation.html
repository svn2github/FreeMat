Section: <A HREF=sec_vtkwidgets.html> Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes </A>
<H3>Usage</H3>
 This class is used to represent and render a vtBorderWidget. To
 use this class, you need to specify the two corners of a rectangular
 region.
<P>
 The class is typically subclassed so that specialized representations can
 be created.  The class defines an API and a default implementation that
 the vtkBorderRepresentation interacts with to render itself in the scene.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkBorderRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkBorderRepresentation
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkBorderRepresentation has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkBorderRepresentation class.
