<H3>Usage</H3>
 This PointPlacer is used to constrain the placement of points on the
 supplied image actor. Additionally, you may set bounds to restrict the 
 placement of the points. The placement of points will then be constrained 
 to lie not only on the ImageActor but also within the bounds specified. 
 If no bounds are specified, they may lie anywhere on the supplied ImageActor.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkImageActorPointPlacer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkImageActorPointPlacer
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkImageActorPointPlacer has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkImageActorPointPlacer class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImageActorPointPlacer = obj.NewInstance ()</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImageActorPointPlacer = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.ComputeWorldPosition (vtkRenderer ren, double displayPos[2], double worldPos[3], double worldOrient[9])</code> -  Given and renderer and a display position in pixels,
 find a world position and orientation. In this class
 an internal vtkBoundedPlanePointPlacer is used to compute
 the world position and orientation. The internal placer
 is set to use the plane of the image actor and the bounds
 of the image actor as the constraints for placing points.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.ComputeWorldPosition (vtkRenderer ren, double displayPos[2], double refWorldPos[2], double worldPos[3], double worldOrient[9])</code> -  This method is identical to the one above since the
 reference position is ignored by the bounded plane
 point placer.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.ValidateWorldPosition (double worldPos[3])</code> -  This method validates a world position by checking to see
 if the world position is valid according to the constraints
 of the internal placer (essentially - is this world position
 on the image?)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.ValidateWorldPosition (double worldPos[3], double worldOrient[9])</code> -  This method is identical to the one above since the bounded
 plane point placer ignores orientation
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.UpdateWorldPosition (vtkRenderer ren, double worldPos[3], double worldOrient[9])</code> -  Update the world position and orientation according the
 the current constraints of the placer. Will be called
 by the representation when it notices that this placer
 has been modified.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.UpdateInternalState ()</code> -  A method for configuring the internal placer according
 to the constraints of the image actor.
 Called by the representation to give the placer a chance
 to update itself, which may cause the MTime to change,
 which would then cause the representation to update
 all of its points
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetImageActor (vtkImageActor )</code> -  Set / get the reference vtkImageActor used to place the points.
 An image actor must be set for this placer to work. An internal
 bounded plane point placer is created and set to match the bounds
 of the displayed image.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkImageActor = obj.GetImageActor ()</code> -  Set / get the reference vtkImageActor used to place the points.
 An image actor must be set for this placer to work. An internal
 bounded plane point placer is created and set to match the bounds
 of the displayed image.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetBounds (double , double , double , double , double , double )</code> -  Optionally, you may set bounds to restrict the placement of the points.
 The placement of points will then be constrained to lie not only on
 the ImageActor but also within the bounds specified. If no bounds are
 specified, they may lie anywhere on the supplied ImageActor.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetBounds (double  a[6])</code> -  Optionally, you may set bounds to restrict the placement of the points.
 The placement of points will then be constrained to lie not only on
 the ImageActor but also within the bounds specified. If no bounds are
 specified, they may lie anywhere on the supplied ImageActor.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj. GetBounds ()</code> -  Optionally, you may set bounds to restrict the placement of the points.
 The placement of points will then be constrained to lie not only on
 the ImageActor but also within the bounds specified. If no bounds are
 specified, they may lie anywhere on the supplied ImageActor.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetWorldTolerance (double s)</code> -  Set the world tolerance. This propagates it to the internal 
 BoundedPlanePointPlacer.
