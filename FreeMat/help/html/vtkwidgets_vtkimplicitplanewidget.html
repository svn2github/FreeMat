<H3>Usage</H3>
 This 3D widget defines an infinite plane that can be interactively placed
 in a scene. The widget is represented by a plane with a normal vector; the
 plane is contained by a bounding box, and where the plane intersects the
 bounding box the edges are shown (possibly tubed). The normal can be
 selected and moved to rotate the plane; the plane itself can be selected
 and translated in various directions. As the plane is moved, the implicit
 plane function and polygon (representing the plane cut against the bounding
 box) is updated.
<P>
 To use this object, just invoke SetInteractor() with the argument of the
 method a vtkRenderWindowInteractor.  You may also wish to invoke
 "PlaceWidget()" to initially position the widget. If the "i" key (for
 "interactor") is pressed, the vtkImplicitPlaneWidget will appear. (See
 superclass documentation for information about changing this behavior.)
 If you select the normal vector, the plane can be arbitrarily rotated. The
 plane can be translated along the normal by selecting the plane and moving
 it. The plane (the plane origin) can also be arbitrary moved by selecting
 the plane with the middle mouse button. The right mouse button can be used
 to uniformly scale the bounding box (moving "up" the box scales larger;
 moving "down" the box scales smaller). Events that occur outside of the
 widget (i.e., no part of the widget is picked) are propagated to any other
 registered obsevers (such as the interaction style).  Turn off the widget
 by pressing the "i" key again (or invoke the Off() method).
<P>
 The vtkImplicitPlaneWidget has several methods that can be used in
 conjunction with other VTK objects.  The GetPolyData() method can be used
 to get a polygonal representation (the single polygon clipped by the
 bounding box).  Typical usage of the widget is to make use of the
 StartInteractionEvent, InteractionEvent, and EndInteractionEvent
 events. The InteractionEvent is called on mouse motion; the other two
 events are called on button down and button up (either left or right
 button). (Note: there is also a PlaceWidgetEvent that is invoked when
 the widget is placed with PlaceWidget().)
<P>
 Some additional features of this class include the ability to control the
 properties of the widget. You do this by setting property values on the
 normal vector (selected and unselected properties); the plane (selected
 and unselected properties); the outline (selected and unselected
 properties); and the edges. The edges may also be tubed or not.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkImplicitPlaneWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkImplicitPlaneWidget
