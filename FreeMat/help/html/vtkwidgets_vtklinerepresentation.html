<H3>Usage</H3>
 This class is a concrete representation for the vtkLineWidget2. It
 represents a straight line with three handles: one at the beginning and
 ending of the line, and one used to translate the line. Through
 interaction with the widget, the line representation can be arbitrarily
 placed in the 3D space.
<P>
 To use this representation, you normally specify the position of the two
 end points (either in world or display coordinates). The PlaceWidget()
 method is also used to intially position the representation.
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkLineRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkLineRepresentation
</PRE>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkLineRepresentation has several methods that can be used.

 of the same type. Make sure you set the handle representation before
 the widget is enabled. (The method InstantiateHandleRepresentation()
 is invoked by the vtkLineWidget2.)

 further.

 will not print the angle value.
