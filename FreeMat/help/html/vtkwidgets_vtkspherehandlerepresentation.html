<H3>Usage</H3>
 This class is a concrete implementation of vtkHandleRepresentation. It 
 renders handles as spherical blobs in 3D space.
<P>
<P>
To create an instance of class vtkSphereHandleRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
<PRE>
  obj = vtkSphereHandleRepresentation
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Methods</H3>
The class vtkSphereHandleRepresentation has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkSphereHandleRepresentation class.
<UL>
<LI>  <code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkSphereHandleRepresentation = obj.NewInstance ()</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkSphereHandleRepresentation = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code> -  Standard methods for instances of this class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetWorldPosition (double p[3])</code> -  Set the position of the point in world and display coordinates. Note 
 that if the position is set outside of the bounding box, it will be 
 clamped to the boundary of the bounding box. This method overloads
 the superclasses' SetWorldPosition() and SetDisplayPosition() in 
 order to set the focal point of the cursor properly.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetDisplayPosition (double p[3])</code> -  Set the position of the point in world and display coordinates. Note 
 that if the position is set outside of the bounding box, it will be 
 clamped to the boundary of the bounding box. This method overloads
 the superclasses' SetWorldPosition() and SetDisplayPosition() in 
 order to set the focal point of the cursor properly.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetTranslationMode (int )</code> -  If translation mode is on, as the widget is moved the bounding box,
 shadows, and cursor are all translated simultaneously as the point moves
 (i.e., the left and middle mouse buttons act the same).  Otherwise, only
 the cursor focal point moves, which is constrained by the bounds of the
 point representation. (Note that the bounds can be scaled up using the
 right mouse button.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>int = obj.GetTranslationMode ()</code> -  If translation mode is on, as the widget is moved the bounding box,
 shadows, and cursor are all translated simultaneously as the point moves
 (i.e., the left and middle mouse buttons act the same).  Otherwise, only
 the cursor focal point moves, which is constrained by the bounds of the
 point representation. (Note that the bounds can be scaled up using the
 right mouse button.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.TranslationModeOn ()</code> -  If translation mode is on, as the widget is moved the bounding box,
 shadows, and cursor are all translated simultaneously as the point moves
 (i.e., the left and middle mouse buttons act the same).  Otherwise, only
 the cursor focal point moves, which is constrained by the bounds of the
 point representation. (Note that the bounds can be scaled up using the
 right mouse button.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.TranslationModeOff ()</code> -  If translation mode is on, as the widget is moved the bounding box,
 shadows, and cursor are all translated simultaneously as the point moves
 (i.e., the left and middle mouse buttons act the same).  Otherwise, only
 the cursor focal point moves, which is constrained by the bounds of the
 point representation. (Note that the bounds can be scaled up using the
 right mouse button.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetSphereRadius (double )</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetSphereRadius ()</code>
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetProperty (vtkProperty )</code> -  Set/Get the handle properties when unselected and selected.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetSelectedProperty (vtkProperty )</code> -  Set/Get the handle properties when unselected and selected.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkProperty = obj.GetProperty ()</code> -  Set/Get the handle properties when unselected and selected.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>vtkProperty = obj.GetSelectedProperty ()</code> -  Set/Get the handle properties when unselected and selected.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>obj.SetHotSpotSize (double )</code> -  Set the "hot spot" size; i.e., the region around the focus, in which the
 motion vector is used to control the constrained sliding action. Note the
 size is specified as a fraction of the length of the diagonal of the 
 point widget's bounding box.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetHotSpotSizeMinValue ()</code> -  Set the "hot spot" size; i.e., the region around the focus, in which the
 motion vector is used to control the constrained sliding action. Note the
 size is specified as a fraction of the length of the diagonal of the 
 point widget's bounding box.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetHotSpotSizeMaxValue ()</code> -  Set the "hot spot" size; i.e., the region around the focus, in which the
 motion vector is used to control the constrained sliding action. Note the
 size is specified as a fraction of the length of the diagonal of the 
 point widget's bounding box.
 </LI>
<LI>  <code>double = obj.GetHotSpotSize ()</code> -  Set the "hot spot" size; i.e., the region around the focus, in which the
 motion vector is used to control the constrained sliding action. Note the
 size is specified as a fraction of the length of the diagonal of the 
 point widget's bounding box.
