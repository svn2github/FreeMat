\section{ISINTEGER Test for Integer Array}

\subsection{Usage}

The syntax for \verb|isinteger| is
\begin{verbatim}
  x = isinteger(y)
\end{verbatim}
and it returns a logical 1 if the argument is an integer.
The decision of whether the argument is an integer or not
is made based on the class of \verb|y|, not on its value.
