\section{SQUEEZE Remove Singleton Dimensions of an Array}

\subsection{Usage}

This function removes the singleton dimensions of an array.  The
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = squeeze(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is a multidimensional array.  Generally speaking, if
\verb|x| is of size \verb|d1 x 1 x d2 x ...|, then \verb|squeeze(x)| is of
size \verb|d1 x d2 x ...|, i.e., each dimension of \verb|x| that was
singular (size 1) is squeezed out.
\subsection{Example}

Here is a many dimensioned, ungainly array, both before and 
after squeezing;
\begin{verbatim}
--> x = zeros(1,4,3,1,1,2);
--> size(x)

ans = 
 1 4 3 1 1 2 

--> y = squeeze(x);
--> size(y)

ans = 
 4 3 2 
\end{verbatim}
