\section{SUBSREF Array Dereferencing}

\subsection{Usage}

This function can be used to index into basic array
types (or structures).  It provides a functional interface
to execute complex indexing expressions such as 
\verb|a.b(3){5}| at run time (i.e. while executing a script or
a function) without resorting to using \verb|eval|.  Note that
this function should be overloaded for use with user defined
classes, and that it cannot be overloaeded for base types.
The basic syntax of the function is:
\begin{verbatim}
   b = subsref(a,s)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|s| is a structure array with two fields. The
first field is
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|type|  is a string containing either \verb|'()'| or
 \verb|'{}'| or \verb|'.'| depending on the form of the call.

\item  \verb|subs| is a cell array or string containing the
 the subscript information.

\end{itemize}
When multiple indexing experssions are combined together
such as \verb|b = a(5).foo{:}|, the \verb|s| array should contain
the following entries
\begin{verbatim}
  s(1).type = '()'  s(1).subs = {5}
  s(2).type = '.'   s(2).subs = 'foo'
  s(3).type = '{}'  s(3).subs = ':'
\end{verbatim}
