\section{TRIU Upper Triangular Matrix Function}

\subsection{Usage}

 
 Returns the upper triangular matrix of a square matrix. The general
 syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = triu(x)
\end{verbatim}
 where x is a square matrix. This returns the upper triangular matrix
 (i.e.: all elements on or below the diagonal are set to 0). You can also
 specify a different diagonal using the alternate form
\begin{verbatim}
   y = triu(x,n)
\end{verbatim}
 where n is the diagonal offset. In this mode, the diagonal specified 
 is not set to zero in the returned matrix (e.g.: tril(x) and tril(x,1))
 will return the same value.
