\section{BITOR Bitwise Boolean Or Operation}

\subsection{Usage}

Performs a bitwise binary or operation on the two arguments and
returns the result.  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = bitor(a,b)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|a| and \verb|b| are multi-dimensional unsigned integer arrays.
The and operation is performed using 32 bit unsigned intermediates.  Note that if a
or b is a scalar, then each element of the other array is or'ed with
that scalar.  Otherwise the two arrays must match in size.
\subsection{Example}

\begin{verbatim}
--> bitand(uint16([1,16,255]),uint16([3,17,128]))

ans = 
   1  16 128 

--> bitand(uint16([1,16,255]),uint16(3))

ans = 
 1 0 3 
\end{verbatim}
