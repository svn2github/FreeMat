\section{VERTCAT Overloaded Vertical Concatenation}

\subsection{Usage}

This is a method for a class that is invoked to concatenate two or more
variables of the same class type together.  Besides being called when
you invoke
\begin{verbatim}
   c = vertcat(a,b,c)
\end{verbatim}
when \verb|a| is a class, it is also called for
\begin{verbatim}
   c = [a;b;c]
\end{verbatim}
when one of the variables is a class.  The exact meaning of 
vertical concatenation depends on the class you have designed.
