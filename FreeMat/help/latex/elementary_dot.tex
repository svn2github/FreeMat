\section{DOT Dot Product Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Computes the scalar dot product of its two arguments.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  y = dot(x,z)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| and \verb|z| are numerical vectors of the same length.  If 
\verb|x| and \verb|z| are multi-dimensional arrays of the same size, then
the dot product is taken along the first non-singleton dimension.
You can also specify the dimension to take the dot product along using
the alternate form
\begin{verbatim}
  y = dot(x,z,dim)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|dim| specifies the dimension to take the dot product along.
