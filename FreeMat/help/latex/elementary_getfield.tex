\section{GETFIELD Get Field Contents}

\subsection{Usage}

Given a structure or structure array, returns the contents of the
specified field.  The first version is for scalar structures, and
has the following syntax
\begin{verbatim}
   y = getfield(x,'fieldname')
\end{verbatim}
and is equivalent to \verb|y = x.fieldname| where \verb|x| is a scalar (1 x 1)
structure.  If \verb|x| is not a scalar structure, then \verb|y| is the 
first value, i.e., it is equivalent to \verb|y = x(1).fieldname|.  
The second form allows you to specify a subindex into a
structure array, and has the following syntax
\begin{verbatim}
    y = getfield(x, {m,n}, 'fieldname')
\end{verbatim}
and is equivalent to \verb|y = x(m,n).fieldname|.  You can chain multiple
references together using this syntax.
