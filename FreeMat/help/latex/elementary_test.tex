\section{TEST Test Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Tests for the argument array to be all logical 1s.  It is 
completely equivalent to the \verb|all| function applied to
a vectorized form of the input.  The syntax for the \verb|test|
function is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = test(x)
\end{verbatim}
and the result is equivalent to \verb|all(x(:))|.
