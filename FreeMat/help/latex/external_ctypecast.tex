\section{CTYPECAST Cast FreeMat Structure to C Structure}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|ctypecast| function is a convenience function for ensuring that
a FreeMat structure fits the definition of a C struct (as defined
via \verb|ctypedefine|.  It does so by encoding the structure
to a byte array using \verb|ctypefreeze| and then recovering it using
the \verb|ctypethaw| function.  The usage is simply
\begin{verbatim}
   s = ctypecast(s,typename)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|s| is the structure and \verb|typename| is the name of the
C structure that describes the desired layout and types for elements
of \verb|s|.  This function is equivalent to calling \verb|ctypefreeze|
and \verb|ctypethaw| in succession on a FreeMat structure.
