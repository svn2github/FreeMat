\section{CTYPEFREEZE Convert FreeMat Structure to C Type}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|ctypefreeze| function is used to convert a FreeMat structure into
a C struct as defined by a C structure typedef.  To use the \verb|cstructfreeze|
function, you must first define the type of the C structure using the 
\verb|ctypedefine| function.  The \verb|ctypefreeze| function then serializes
a FreeMat structure to a set of bytes, and returns it as an array.  The
usage for \verb|ctypefreeze| is
\begin{verbatim}
  byte_array = ctypefreeze(mystruct, 'typename')
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|mystruct| is the array we want to 'freeze' to a memory array,
and \verb|typename| is the name of the C type that we want the resulting
byte array to conform to.
