\section{CTYPENEW Create New Instance of C Structure}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|ctypenew| function is a convenience function for
creating a FreeMat structure that corresponds to a C
structure.  The entire structure is initialized with zeros.
This has some negative implications, because if the 
structure definition uses \verb|cenums|, they may come out
as \verb|'unknown'| values if there are no enumerations corresponding
to zero.  The use of the function is
\begin{verbatim}
   a = ctypenew('typename')
\end{verbatim}
which creates a single structure of C structure type \verb|'typename'|.
To create an array of structures, we can provide a second argument
\begin{verbatim}
   a = ctypenew('typename',count)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|count| is the number of elements in the structure array.
