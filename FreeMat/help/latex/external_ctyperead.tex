\section{CTYPEREAD Read a C Structure From File}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|ctyperead| function is a convenience function for
reading a C structure from a file.  This is generally a
very bad idea, as direct writing of C structures to files
is notoriously unportable.  Consider yourself warned.  The
syntax for this function is
\begin{verbatim}
   a = ctyperead(fid,'typename')
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|'typename'| is a string containing the name of the
C structure as defined using \verb|ctypedefine|, and \verb|fid|
is the file handle returned by the \verb|fopen| command.  Note
that this form will read a single structure from the file.
If you want to read multiple structures into an array, 
use the following form
\begin{verbatim}
   a = ctyperead(fid,'typename',count)
\end{verbatim}
Note that the way this function works is by using \verb|ctypesize|
to compute the size of the structure, reading that many bytes
from the file, and then calling \verb|ctypethaw| on the resulting
buffer.  A consequence of this behavior is that the byte-endian
corrective behavior of FreeMat does not work.
