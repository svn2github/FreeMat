\section{CTYPESIZE Compute Size of C Struct}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|ctypesize| function is used to compute the size of a C structure
that is defined using the \verb|ctypedefine| function.  The usage of 
\verb|ctypesize| is 
\begin{verbatim}
   size = ctypesize('typename')
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|typename| is the name of the C structure you want to compute
the size of.  The returned count is measured in bytes.  Note that as
indicated in the help for \verb|ctypedefine| that FreeMat does not 
automatically pad the entries of the structure to match the particulars
of your C compiler.  Instead, the assumption is that you have adequate
padding entries in your structure to align the FreeMat members with the
C ones.  See \verb|ctypedefine| for more details.  You can also specify
an optional count parameter if you want to determine how large multiple
structures are
\begin{verbatim}
   size = ctypesize('typename',count)
\end{verbatim}
