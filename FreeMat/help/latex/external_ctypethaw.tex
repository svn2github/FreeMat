\section{CTYPETHAW Convert C Struct to FreeMat Structure}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|ctypethaw| function is used to convert a C structure that is
encoded in a byte array into a FreeMat structure using a C structure
typedef.  To use the \verb|ctypethaw| function, you must first define
the type of the C structure using the \verb|ctypedefine| function.  The
usage of \verb|ctypethaw| is
\begin{verbatim}
  mystruct = ctypethaw(byte_array, 'typename')
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|byte\_array| is a \verb|uint8| array containing the bytes that encode
the C structure, and \verb|typename| is a string that contains the type
description as registered with \verb|ctypedefine|.  If you want to
retrieve multiple structures from a single byte array, you can specify
a count as
\begin{verbatim}
  mystruct = ctypethaw(byte_array, 'typename', count)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|count| is an integer containing the number of structures to 
retrieve.  Sometimes it is also useful to retrieve only part of the
structure from a byte array, and then (based on the contents of the
structure) retrieve more data.  In this case, you can retrieve the
residual byte array using the optional second output argument of
\verb|ctypethaw|:
\begin{verbatim}
  [mystruct,byte_array_remaining] = ctypethaw(byte_array, 'typename',...)
\end{verbatim}
