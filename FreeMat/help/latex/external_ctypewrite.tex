\section{CTYPEWRITE Write a C Typedef To File}

\subsection{Usage }

The \verb|ctypewrite| function is a convenience function for
writing a C typedef to a file.  This is generally a very
bad idea, as writing of C typedefs to files is notoriously
unportable.  Consider yourself warned.  The syntax for this
function is 
\begin{verbatim}
  ctypewrite(fid,a,'typename')
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|a| is the FreeMat typedef to write, \verb|'typename'| is
a string containing the name of the C typedef to use when
writing the typedef to the file (previously defined using
\verb|ctypedefine|), and \verb|fid| is the file handle returned
by \verb|fopen|.
