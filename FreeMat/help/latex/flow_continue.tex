\section{CONTINUE Continue Execution In Loop}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|continue| statement is used to change the order of
execution within a loop.  The \verb|continue| statement can
be used inside a \verb|for| loop or a \verb|while| loop.  The
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   continue
\end{verbatim}
inside the body of the loop.  The \verb|continue| statement
forces execution to start at the top of the loop with
the next iteration.  The examples section shows how
the \verb|continue| statement works.
\subsection{Example}

Here is a simple example of using a \verb|continue| statement.
We want to sum the integers from \verb|1| to \verb|10|, but not
the number \verb|5|.  We will use a \verb|for| loop and a continue
statement.
\begin{verbatim}
    continue_ex.m
function accum = continue_ex
  accum = 0;
  for i=1:10
    if (i==5)
      continue;
    end
    accum = accum + 1; %skipped if i == 5!
  end
\end{verbatim}
The function is exercised here:
\begin{verbatim}
--> continue_ex

ans = 
 9 

--> sum([1:4,6:10])

ans = 
 50 
\end{verbatim}
