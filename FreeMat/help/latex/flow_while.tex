\section{WHILE While Loop}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|while| loop executes a set of statements as long as
a the test condition remains \verb|true|.  The syntax of a 
\verb|while| loop is
\begin{verbatim}
  while test_expression
     statements
  end
\end{verbatim}
Note that a conditional expression is considered true if 
the real part of the result of the expression contains
any non-zero elements (this strange convention is adopted
for compatibility with MATLAB).
\subsection{Examples}

Here is a \verb|while| loop that adds the integers from \verb|1|
to \verb|100|:
\begin{verbatim}
--> accum = 0;
--> k=1;
--> while (k<=100), accum = accum + k; k = k + 1; end
--> accum

ans = 
 5050 
\end{verbatim}
