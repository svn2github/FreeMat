\section{ADDPATH Add}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|addpath| routine adds a set of directories to the current path.
The first form takes a single directory and adds it to the beginning
or top of the path:
\begin{verbatim}
  addpath('directory')
\end{verbatim}
The second form add several directories to the top of the path:
\begin{verbatim}
  addpath('dir1','dir2',...,'dirn')
\end{verbatim}
Finally, you can provide a flag to control where the directories get
added to the path
\begin{verbatim}
  addpath('dir1','dir2',...,'dirn','-flag')
\end{verbatim}
where if \verb|flag| is either \verb|'-0'| or \verb|'-begin'|, the directories are
added to the top of the path, and if the \verb|flag| is either \verb|'-1'| or 
\verb|'-end'| the directories are added to the bottom (or end) of the path.
