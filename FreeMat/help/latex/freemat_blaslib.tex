\section{BLASLIB Select BLAS library}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|blaslib| function allows you to select the FreeMat blas library.
It has two modes of operation.  The first is to select blas library:
\begin{verbatim}
  blaslib LIB_NAME
\end{verbatim}
If you want to see current blas library selected
issue a \verb|blaslib| command with no arguments.
\begin{verbatim}
   blaslib
\end{verbatim}
the returned list of libraries will include an asterix next to the library
currently selected.  If no library is selected, FreeMat will use its internal
(reference) BLAS implementation, which is slow, but portable.
