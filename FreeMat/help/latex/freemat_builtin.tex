\section{BUILTIN Evaulate Builtin Function}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|builtin| function evaluates a built in function
with the given name, bypassing any overloaded functions.
The syntax of \verb|builtin| is
\begin{verbatim}
  [y1,y2,...,yn] = builtin(fname,x1,x2,...,xm)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|fname| is the name of the function to call.  Apart
from the fact that \verb|fname| must be a string, and that \verb|builtin|
always calls the non-overloaded method, it operates exactly like
\verb|feval|.  Note that unlike MATLAB, \verb|builtin| does not force
evaluation to an actual compiled function.  It simply subverts
the activation of overloaded method calls.
