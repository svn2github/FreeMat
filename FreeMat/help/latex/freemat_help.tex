\section{HELP Help}

\subsection{Usage}

Displays help on a function available in FreeMat.  The help function
takes one argument:
\begin{verbatim}
  help topic
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|topic| is the topic to look for help on.  For scripts, the 
result of running \verb|help| is the contents of the comments at the top
of the file.  If FreeMat finds no comments, then it simply displays
the function declaration.
