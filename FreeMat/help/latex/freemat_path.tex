\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|path| routine has one of the following syntaxes.  In the first form
\begin{verbatim}
  x = path
\end{verbatim}
\verb|path| simply returns the current path.  In the second, the current path
is replaced by the argument string \verb|'thepath'|
\begin{verbatim}
  path('thepath')
\end{verbatim}
In the third form, a new path is appended to the current search path
\begin{verbatim}
  path(path,'newpath')
\end{verbatim}
In the fourth form, a new path is prepended to the current search path
\begin{verbatim}
  path('newpath',path)
\end{verbatim}
In the final form, the path command prints out the current path
\begin{verbatim}
  path
\end{verbatim}
