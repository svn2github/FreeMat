\section{PROFILER Control Profiling}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|profile| function allows you to control the FreeMat profiler.
It has two modes of operation.  The first is to enable-disable
the profiler.  To turn on profiling:
\begin{verbatim}
  profiler on
\end{verbatim}
to turn off profiling, use
\begin{verbatim}
  profiler off
\end{verbatim}
Note that regardless of the state of the profiler, only functions
and scripts are profiled.  Commands entered on the command line
are not profiled.  To see information that has accumulated in a
profile, you use the variant of the command:
\begin{verbatim}
  profiler list symbol1 symbol2 ...
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|symbol1|, \verb|symbol2| are the functions or scripts on which
profiling information is desired.  If you want to see current profile
status issue a \verb|profile| command with no arguments.
\begin{verbatim}
   profiler
\end{verbatim}
