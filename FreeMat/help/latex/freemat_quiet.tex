\section{QUIET Control the Verbosity of the Interpreter}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|quiet| function controls how verbose the interpreter
is when executing code.  The syntax for the function is
\begin{verbatim}
   quiet flag
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|flag| is one of
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|'normal'| - normal output from the interpreter

\item  \verb|'quiet'| - only intentional output (e.g. \verb|printf| calls and
\verb|disp| calls) is printed.  The output of expressions that are not
terminated in semicolons are not printed.

\item  \verb|'silent'| - nothing is printed to the output.

\end{itemize}
The \verb|quiet| command also returns the current quiet flag.
