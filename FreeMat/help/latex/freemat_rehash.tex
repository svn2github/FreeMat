\section{REHASH Rehash Directory Caches}

\subsection{Usage}

Usually, FreeMat will automatically determine when M Files have
changed, and pick up changes you have made to M files.  Sometimes,
you have to force a refresh.  Use the \verb|rehash| command for this
purpose.  The syntax for its use is 
\begin{verbatim}
  rehash
\end{verbatim}
