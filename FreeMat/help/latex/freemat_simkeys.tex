\section{SIMKEYS Simulate Keypresses from the User}

\subsection{Usage}

This routine simulates keystrokes from the user on FreeMat.
The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   otext = simkeys(text)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|text| is a string to simulate as input to the console.
The output of the commands are captured and returned in the 
string \verb|otext|.  This is primarily used by the testing 
infrastructure.
