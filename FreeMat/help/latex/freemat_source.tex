\section{SOURCE Execute an Arbitrary File}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|source| function executes the contents of the given
filename one line at a time (as if it had been typed at
the \verb|-->| prompt).  The \verb|source| function syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
  source(filename)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|filename| is a \verb|string| containing the name of
the file to process. 
\subsection{Example}

First, we write some commands to a file (note that it does
not end in the usual \verb|.m| extension):
\begin{verbatim}
    source_test
a = 32;
b = a;
printf('a is %d and b is %d\n',a,b);
\end{verbatim}
Now we source the resulting file.
\begin{verbatim}
--> clear a b
--> source source_test
a is 32 and b is 32
\end{verbatim}
