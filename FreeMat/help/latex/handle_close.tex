\section{CLOSE Close Figure Window}

\subsection{Usage}

Closes a figure window, either the currently active window, a 
window with a specific handle, or all figure windows.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   close(handle)
\end{verbatim}
in which case the figure window with the speicified \verb|handle| is
closed.  Alternately, issuing the command with no argument
\begin{verbatim}
   close
\end{verbatim}
is equivalent to closing the currently active figure window.  Finally
the command
\begin{verbatim}
   close('all')
\end{verbatim}
closes all figure windows currently open.
