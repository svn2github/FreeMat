\section{DRAWNOW Flush the Event Queue}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|drawnow| function can be used to process the events in the
event queue of the FreeMat application.  The syntax for its use
is
\begin{verbatim}
   drawnow
\end{verbatim}
Now that FreeMat is threaded, you do not generally need to call this
function, but it is provided for compatibility.
