\section{FIGURE Figure Window Select and Create Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Changes the active figure window to the specified figure
number.  The general syntax for its use is 
\begin{verbatim}
  figure(number)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|number| is the figure number to use. If the figure window 
corresponding to \verb|number| does not already exist, a new 
window with this number is created.  If it does exist
then it is brought to the forefront and made active.
You can use \verb|gcf| to obtain the number of the current figure.

Note that the figure number is also the handle for the figure.
While for most graphical objects (e.g., axes, lines, images), the
handles are large integers, for figures, the handle is the same
as the figure number.  This means that the figure number can be
passed to \verb|set| and \verb|get| to modify the properties of the
current figure, (e.g., the colormap).  So, for figure \verb|3|, for 
example, you can use \verb|get(3,'colormap')| to retrieve the colormap
for the current figure.
