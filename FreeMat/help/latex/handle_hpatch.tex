\section{HPATCH Create a patch object}

\subsection{Usage}

Creates a patch object and parents it to the current axis.  The
syntax for its use is 
\begin{verbatim}
  handle = hpatch(property,value,property,value,...)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|property| and \verb|value| are set.  The handle ID for the
resulting object is returned.  It is automatically added to
the children of the current axis.
