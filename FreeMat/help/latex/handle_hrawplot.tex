\section{HRAWPLOT Generate a Raw Plot File}

\subsection{Usage}

This function takes a sequence of commands, and generates
a raw plot (to a file) that renders the commands.  It is 
a useful tool for creating high quality fully customized 
PDF plots from within FreeMat scripts that are portable.  The
syntax for its use 
\begin{verbatim}
  hrawplot(filename,commands)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|filename| is the name of the file to plot to, 
and \verb|commands| is a cell array of strings.  Each entry in the 
cell array contains a string with a command text.  The
commands describe a simple mini-language for describing
plots.  The complete dictionary of commands is given
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|LINE x1 y1 x2 y2| -- draw a line

\item  \verb|FONT name size| -- select a font of the given name and size

\item  \verb|TEXT x1 y1 string| -- draw the given text string at the given location
