\section{NEWPLOT Get Handle For Next Plot}

\subsection{Usage}

Returns the handle for the next plot operation.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  h = newplot
\end{verbatim}
This routine checks the \verb|nextplot| properties of the current
figure and axes to see if they are set to \verb|replace| or not. If
the figures \verb|nextplot| property is set to replace, the current
figure is cleared.  If the axes \verb|nextplot| property is set to
\verb|replace| then the axes are cleared for the next operation.
