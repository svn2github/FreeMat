\section{SET Set Object Property}

\subsection{Usage}

This function allows you to change the value associated
with a property.  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  set(handle,property,value,property,value,...)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|property| is a string containing the name of the
property, and \verb|value| is the value for that property. The
type of the variable \verb|value| depends on the property being
set.  See the help for the properties to see what values
you can set.
