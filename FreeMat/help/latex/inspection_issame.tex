\section{ISSAME Test If Two Arrays Are Identical}

\subsection{Usage}

Tests for two arrays to be identical.  The syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = issame(a,b)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|a| and \verb|b| are two arrays to compare.  This
comparison succeeds only if \verb|a| and \verb|b| are of the
same data type, size, and contents.  Unlike numerical
equivalence tests, the \verb|issame| function considers
\verb|NaN| to be equal in both arguments.
