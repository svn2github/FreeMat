\section{LENGTH Length of an Array}

\subsection{Usage}

Returns the length of an array \verb|x|.  The syntax for its use
is 
\begin{verbatim}
   y = length(x)
\end{verbatim}
and is defined as the maximum length of \verb|x| along any of its
dimensions, i.e., \verb|max(size(x))|.  If you want to determine the
number of elements in \verb|x|, use the \verb|numel| function instead.
\subsection{Example}

For a \verb|4 x 4 x 3| matrix, the length is \verb|4|, not \verb|48|, as you 
might expect.
\begin{verbatim}
--> x = rand(4,4,3);
--> length(x)

ans = 
 4 
\end{verbatim}
