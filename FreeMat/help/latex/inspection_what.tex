\section{WHAT List FreeMat Files In Directory}

\subsection{Usage}

Lists files in a directory (or the current directory if no
argument is supplied) that are relevant to FreeMat.  These
are \verb|M|-files, \verb|MAT|-files, and class directories.  There
are several syntaxes for its use.  The first is
\begin{verbatim}
   what
\end{verbatim}
which lists the aforementioned items.  If you provide a 
path instead
\begin{verbatim}
   what path-to-folder
\end{verbatim}
then \verb|what| will list the relevant FreeMat items in the specified
directory.
