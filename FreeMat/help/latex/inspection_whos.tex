\section{WHOS Describe Currently Defined Variables With Memory Usage}

\subsection{Usage}

Reports information on either all variables in the current context
or on a specified set of variables.  For each variable, the \verb|who|
function indicates the size and type of the variable as well as 
if it is a global or persistent.  There are two formats for the 
function call.  The first is the explicit form, in which a list
of variables are provided:
\begin{verbatim}
  whos a1 a2 ...
\end{verbatim}
In the second form
\begin{verbatim}
  whos
\end{verbatim}
the \verb|whos| function lists all variables defined in the current 
context (as well as global and persistent variables). Note that
there are two alternate forms for calling the \verb|whos| function:
\begin{verbatim}
  whos 'a1' 'a2' ...
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
  whos('a1','a2',...)
\end{verbatim}
