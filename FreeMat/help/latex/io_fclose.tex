\section{FCLOSE File Close Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Closes a file handle, or all open file handles.  The general syntax
for its use is either
\begin{verbatim}
  fclose(handle)
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
  fclose('all')
\end{verbatim}
In the first case a specific file is closed,  In the second, all open
files are closed.  Note that until a file is closed the file buffers
are not flushed.  Returns a '0' if the close was successful and a '-1' if
the close failed for some reason.
\subsection{Example}

A simple example of a file being opened with \verb|fopen| and then closed with \verb|fclose|.
\begin{verbatim}
--> fp = fopen('test.dat','wb','ieee-le')

fp = 
 3 

--> fclose(fp)
\end{verbatim}
