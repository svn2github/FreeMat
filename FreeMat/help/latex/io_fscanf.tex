Reads values from a file.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

controls the format of the input, \verb|size| specifies the amount of data to be read. Values that are parsed
from the \verb|text| are stored in a. Note that fscanf is vectorized - the format string is reused as long as
there are entries in the \verb|text| string.
See \verb|printf| for a description of the format.  Note that if
the file is at the end-of-file, the fscanf will return
