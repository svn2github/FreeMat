\section{IMREAD Read Image File To Matrix}

\subsection{Usage}

Reads the image data from the given file into a matrix.  Note that
FreeMat's support for \verb|imread| is not complete.  Only some of the
formats specified in the MATLAB API are implemented.  The syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  [A,map,alpha] = imread(filename)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|filename| is the name of the file to read from.  The returned
arrays \verb|A| contain the image data, \verb|map| contains the colormap information
(for indexed images), and \verb|alpha| contains the alphamap (transparency).
The returned values will depend on the type of the original image.  Generally
you can read images in the \verb|jpg,png,xpm,ppm| and some other formats.
