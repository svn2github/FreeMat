\section{PAUSE Pause Script Execution}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|pause| function can be used to pause execution of FreeMat
scripts.  There are several syntaxes for its use.  The first form
is
\begin{verbatim}
   pause
\end{verbatim}
This form of the \verb|pause| function pauses FreeMat until you press
any key.  The second form of the \verb|pause| function takes an argument
\begin{verbatim}
   pause(p)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|p| is the number of seconds to pause FreeMat for.  The pause
argument should be accurate to a millisecond on all supported platforms.
Alternately, you can control all \verb|pause| statements using:
\begin{verbatim}
   pause on
\end{verbatim}
which enables pauses and
\begin{verbatim}
   pause off
\end{verbatim}
which disables all \verb|pause| statements, both with and without arguments.
