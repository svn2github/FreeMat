\section{SSCANF Formated String Input Function (C-Style)}

\subsection{Usage}

Reads values from a string.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  [a, count, errmsg, nextind] = sscanf(text,format,[size])
\end{verbatim}
Here \verb|format| is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the input, \verb|size| specifies the amount of data to be read. Values that are parsed
from the \verb|text| are stored in a. Note that sscanf is vectorized - the format string is reused as long as
there are entries in the \verb|text| string. See \verb|printf|
for a description of the format.
