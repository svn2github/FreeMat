\section{STR2NUM Convert a String to a Number}

\subsection{Usage}

Converts a string to a number.  The general syntax for its use
is
\begin{verbatim}
  x = str2num(string)
\end{verbatim}
Here \verb|string| is the data string, which contains the data to 
be converted into a number.  The output is in double precision,
and must be typecasted to the appropriate type based on what
you need.  Note that by definition, \verb|str2num| is entirely 
equivalent to \verb|eval(['[' string ']'],[])| with all of the 
associated problems where \verb|string| contains text that causes
side effects.
