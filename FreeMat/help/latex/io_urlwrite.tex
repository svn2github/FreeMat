\section{URLWRITE Retrieve a URL into a File}

\subsection{Usage}

Given a URL and a timeout, attempts to retrieve the URL and write the
contents to a file.  The syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
   f = urlwrite(url,filename,timeout)
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|timeout| is in milliseconds.  Note that the URL must be a complete
spec (i.e., including the name of the resource you wish to retrieve).  So
for example, you cannot use \verb|http://www.google.com| as a URL, but must 
instead use \verb|http://www.google.com/index.html|.
