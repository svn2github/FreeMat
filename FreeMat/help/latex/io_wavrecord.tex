\section{WAVRECORD}

\subsection{Usage}

Records linear PCM sound from the audio system.  This function is
only available if the \verb|portaudio| library was available when FreeMat
was built.  The syntax for this command is one of:
\begin{verbatim}
  y = wavrecord(samples,rate)
  y = wavrecord(...,channels)
  y = wavrecord(...,'datatype')
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|samples| is the number of samples to record, and \verb|rate| is the
sampling rate.  If not specified, the \verb|rate| defaults to \verb|11025Hz|.
If you want to record in stero, specify \verb|channels = 2|.  Finally, you
can specify the type of the recorded data (defaults to \verb|FM_DOUBLE|).
Valid choices are \verb|float, double, int32, int16, int8, uint8|.
