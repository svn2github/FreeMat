\section{XMLREAD Read an XML Document into FreeMat}

\subsection{Usage}

Given a filename, reads an XML document, parses it, and
returns the result as a FreeMat data structure.  The syntax for its
use is:
\begin{verbatim}
   p = xmlread(filename)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|filename| is a \verb|string|.  The
resulting object \verb|p| is a data structure containing the information
in the document.  Note that the returned object \verb|p| is not the same
object as the one returned by MATLAB's \verb|xmlread|, although the 
information content is the same.  The output is largely compatible with the 
output of the parseXML example in the \verb|xmlread| documentation of the
MATLAB API.
