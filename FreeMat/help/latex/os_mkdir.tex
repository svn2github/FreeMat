\section{MKDIR Make Directory}

\subsection{Usage}

Creates a directory.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  mkdir('dirname')
\end{verbatim}
which creates the directory \verb|dirname| if it does not exist.  The argument
\verb|dirname| can be either a relative path or an absolute path.  For compatibility
with MATLAB, the following syntax is also allowed
\begin{verbatim}
  mkdir('parentdir','dirname')
\end{verbatim}
which attempts to create a directory \verb|dirname| in the directory given by \verb|parentdir|.
However, this simply calls \verb|mkdir([parentdir dirsep dirname])|, and if this is not
the required behavior, please file an enhancement request to have it changed.  Note that
\verb|mkdir| returns a logical \verb|1| if the call succeeded, and a logical \verb|0| if not.
