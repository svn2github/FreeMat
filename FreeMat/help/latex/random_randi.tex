\section{RANDI Uniformly Distributed Integer}

\subsection{Usage}

Generates an array of uniformly distributed integers between
the two supplied limits.  The general syntax for \verb|randi| is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = randi(low,high)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|low| and \verb|high| are arrays of integers.  Scalars
can be used for one of the arguments.  The output \verb|y| is
a uniformly distributed pseudo-random number between \verb|low|
and \verb|high| (inclusive).
\subsection{Example}

Here is an example of a set of random integers between 
zero and 5:
\begin{verbatim}
--> randi(zeros(1,6),5*ones(1,6))

ans = 
 1 0 4 1 5 0 
\end{verbatim}
