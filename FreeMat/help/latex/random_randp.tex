\section{RANDP Generate Poisson Random Variable}

\subsection{Usage}

Generates a vector Poisson random variables with the given
parameters.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = randp(nu),
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|nu| is an array containing the rate parameters
for the generated random variables.  
\subsection{Function Internals}

A Poisson random variable is generally defined by taking the
limit of a binomial distribution as the sample size becomes
large, with the expected number of successes being fixed (so
that the probability of success decreases as \verb|1/N|).  
The Poisson distribution is given by
\[
  P_{\nu}(n) = \frac{\nu^n e^{-nu}}{n!}.
\]
\subsection{Example}

Here is an exmaple of using \verb|randp| to generate some Poisson
random variables, and also using \verb|randbin| to do the same
using \verb|N=1000| trials to approximate the Poisson result.
\begin{verbatim}
--> randp(33*ones(1,10))

ans = 
 39 39 27 27 35 31 29 28 33 25 

--> randbin(1000*ones(1,10),33/1000*ones(1,10))

ans = 
 31 17 42 19 34 36 34 41 30 30 
\end{verbatim}
