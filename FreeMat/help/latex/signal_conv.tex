\section{CONV Convolution Function}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|conv| function performs a one-dimensional convolution of two
vector arguments.  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
     z = conv(x,y)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| and \verb|y| are vectors.  The output is of length \verb|nx + ny -1|.
The \verb|conv| function calls \verb|conv2| to do the calculation.  See its
help for more details.
