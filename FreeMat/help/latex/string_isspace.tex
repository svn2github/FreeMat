\section{ISSPACE Test for Space Characters in a String}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|isspace| functions returns a logical array that is 1 
for characters in the argument string that are spaces, and 
is a logical 0 for characters in the argument that are not
spaces.  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   x = isspace(s)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|s| is a \verb|string|.  A blank character is considered
a space, newline, tab, carriage return, formfeed, and vertical
tab.
\subsection{Example}

A simple example of \verb|isspace|:
\begin{verbatim}
--> isspace('  hello there world ')

ans = 
 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 
\end{verbatim}
