\section{STRREP String Replace Function}

\subsection{Usage}

Replace every occurance of one string with another.  The
general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  p = strrep(source,find,replace)
\end{verbatim}
Every instance of the string \verb|find| in the string \verb|source| is
replaced with the string \verb|replace|.  Any of \verb|source|, \verb|find|
and \verb|replace| can be a cell array of strings, in which case
each entry has the replace operation applied.
\subsection{Example}

Here are some examples of the use of \verb|strrep|.  First the case
where are the arguments are simple strings
\begin{verbatim}
--> strrep('Matlab is great','Matlab','FreeMat')

ans = 
FreeMat is great
\end{verbatim}
And here we have the replace operation for a number of strings:
\begin{verbatim}
--> strrep({'time is money';'A stitch in time';'No time for games'},'time','money')

ans = 
 [money is money] 
 [A stitch in money] 
 [No money for games] 
\end{verbatim}
