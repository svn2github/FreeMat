\section{CAST Typecast Variable to Specified Type}

\subsection{Usage}

The \verb|cast| function allows you to typecast a variable from one
type to another.  The syntax for its use is 
\begin{verbatim}
    y = cast(x,toclass)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|toclass| is the name of the class to cast \verb|x| to.  Note
that the typecast must make sense, and that \verb|toclass| must be
one of the builtin types.  The current list of supported types is
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|'cell'| for cell-arrays

\item  \verb|'struct'| for structure-arrays

\item  \verb|'logical'| for logical arrays

\item  \verb|'uint8'| for unsigned 8-bit integers

\item  \verb|'int8'| for signed 8-bit integers

\item  \verb|'uint16'| for unsigned 16-bit integers

\item  \verb|'int16'| for signed 16-bit integers

\item  \verb|'uint32'| for unsigned 32-bit integers

\item  \verb|'int32'| for signed 32-bit integers

\item  \verb|'uint64'| for unsigned 64-bit integers

\item  \verb|'int64'| for signed 64-bit integers

\item  \verb|'float'| for 32-bit floating point numbers

\item  \verb|'single'| is a synonym for \verb|'float'|

\item  \verb|'double'| for 64-bit floating point numbers

\item  \verb|'char'| for string arrays

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Example}

Here is an example of a typecast from a float to an 8-bit integer
\begin{verbatim}
--> cast(pi,'uint8')

ans = 
 3 
\end{verbatim}
and here we cast an array of arbitrary integers to a logical array
\begin{verbatim}
--> cast([1 0 3 0],'logical')

ans = 
 1 0 1 0 
\end{verbatim}
