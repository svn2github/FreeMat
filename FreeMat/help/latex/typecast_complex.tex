\section{COMPLEX Create a Complex Number}

\subsection{Usage}

Converts the two real input arguments into the real and imaginary part
(respectively) of a complex number.  The syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = complex(x,z)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| and \verb|z| are \verb|n|-dimensional numerical arrays.  The usual rules
for binary operators apply (i.e., one of the arguments can be a scalar,
if either is of type \verb|single| the output is single, etc.).
