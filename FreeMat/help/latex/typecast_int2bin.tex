\section{INT2BIN Convert Integer Arrays to Binary}

\subsection{Usage}

Computes the binary decomposition of an integer array to the specified
number of bits.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = int2bin(x,n)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is a multi-dimensional integer array, and \verb|n| is the number
of bits to expand it to.  The output array \verb|y| has one extra dimension
to it than the input.  The bits are expanded along this extra dimension.
\subsection{Example}

The following piece of code demonstrates various uses of the int2bin
function.  First the simplest example:
\begin{verbatim}
--> A = [2;5;6;2]

A = 
 2 
 5 
 6 
 2 

--> int2bin(A,8)

ans = 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 
 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 

--> A = [1;2;-5;2]

A = 
  1 
  2 
 -5 
  2 

--> int2bin(A,8)

ans = 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 
 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 
\end{verbatim}
