\section{SINGLE Convert to 32-bit Floating Point}

\subsection{Usage}

A synonym for the \verb|float| function, converts the argument to
a 32-bit floating point number.  The syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = single(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is an \verb|n|-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion 
follows the general C rules.  Note that both \verb|NaN| and \verb|Inf| 
are both preserved under type conversion.
