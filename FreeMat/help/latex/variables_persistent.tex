\section{PERSISTENT Persistent Variables}

\subsection{Usage}

Persistent variables are variables whose value persists between
calls to a function or script.  The general syntax for its
use is
\begin{verbatim}
   persistent variable1 variable2 ... variableN
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|persistent| statement must occur before the variable
is the tagged as persistent.  Per the MATLAB API documentation
an empty variable is created when the \verb|persistent| statement
is called.
\subsection{Example}

Here is an example of a function that counts how many
times it has been called.
\begin{verbatim}
    count_calls.m
function count_calls
  persistent ccount
  if isempty(ccount); ccount = 0; end;
  ccount = ccount + 1;
  printf('Function has been called %d times\n',ccount);
\end{verbatim}
We now call the function several times:
\begin{verbatim}
--> for i=1:10; count_calls; end
Function has been called 1 times
Function has been called 2 times
Function has been called 3 times
Function has been called 4 times
Function has been called 5 times
Function has been called 6 times
Function has been called 7 times
Function has been called 8 times
Function has been called 9 times
Function has been called 10 times
\end{verbatim}
