\section{vtkAssemblyPaths}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkAssemblyPaths represents an assembly hierarchy as a list of 
 vtkAssemblyPath. Each path represents the complete path from the
 top level assembly (if any) down to the leaf prop.

To create an instance of class vtkAssemblyPaths, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkAssemblyPaths
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkAssemblyPaths has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkAssemblyPaths class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkAssemblyPaths = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkAssemblyPaths = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.AddItem (vtkAssemblyPath p)| -  Add a path to the list.

\item  \verb|obj.RemoveItem (vtkAssemblyPath p)| -  Remove a path from the list.

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsItemPresent (vtkAssemblyPath p)| -  Determine whether a particular path is present. Returns its position
 in the list.

\item  \verb|vtkAssemblyPath = obj.GetNextItem ()| -  Get the next path in the list.

\item  \verb|long = obj.GetMTime ()| -  Override the standard GetMTime() to check for the modified times
 of the paths.

\end{itemize}
