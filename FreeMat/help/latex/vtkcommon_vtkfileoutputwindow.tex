\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkFileOutputWindow has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkFileOutputWindow class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkFileOutputWindow = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkFileOutputWindow = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.DisplayText (string )| -  Put the text into the log file.
 New lines are converted to carriage return new lines.

\item  \verb|obj.SetFileName (string )| -  Sets the name for the log file.

\item  \verb|string = obj.GetFileName ()| -  Sets the name for the log file.

\item  \verb|obj.SetFlush (int )| -  Turns on buffer flushing for the output 
 to the log file.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetFlush ()| -  Turns on buffer flushing for the output 
 to the log file.

\item  \verb|obj.FlushOn ()| -  Turns on buffer flushing for the output 
 to the log file.

\item  \verb|obj.FlushOff ()| -  Turns on buffer flushing for the output 
 to the log file.

\item  \verb|obj.SetAppend (int )| -  Setting append will cause the log file to be
 opened in append mode.  Otherwise, if the log file exists,
 it will be overwritten each time the vtkFileOutputWindow
 is created.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetAppend ()| -  Setting append will cause the log file to be
 opened in append mode.  Otherwise, if the log file exists,
 it will be overwritten each time the vtkFileOutputWindow
 is created.

\item  \verb|obj.AppendOn ()| -  Setting append will cause the log file to be
 opened in append mode.  Otherwise, if the log file exists,
 it will be overwritten each time the vtkFileOutputWindow
 is created.

\item  \verb|obj.AppendOff ()| -  Setting append will cause the log file to be
 opened in append mode.  Otherwise, if the log file exists,
 it will be overwritten each time the vtkFileOutputWindow
 is created.

\end{itemize}
