\section{vtkGaussianRandomSequence}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkGaussianRandomSequence is a sequence of pseudo random numbers
 distributed according to the Gaussian/normal distribution (mean=0 and
 standard deviation=1)

 This is just an interface.

To create an instance of class vtkGaussianRandomSequence, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkGaussianRandomSequence
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkGaussianRandomSequence has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkGaussianRandomSequence class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkGaussianRandomSequence = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkGaussianRandomSequence = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScaledValue (double mean, double standardDeviation)| -  Convenient method to return a value given the mean and standard deviation
 of the Gaussian distribution from the the Gaussian distribution of mean=0
 and standard deviation=1.0. There is an initial implementation that can
 be overridden by a subclass.

\end{itemize}
