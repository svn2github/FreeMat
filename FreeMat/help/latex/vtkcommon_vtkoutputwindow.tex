\section{vtkOutputWindow}

\subsection{Usage}

 This class is used to encapsulate all text output, so that it will work
 with operating systems that have a stdout and stderr, and ones that
 do not.  (i.e windows does not).  Sub-classes can be provided which can
 redirect the output to a window.

To create an instance of class vtkOutputWindow, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkOutputWindow
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkOutputWindow has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkOutputWindow class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkOutputWindow = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkOutputWindow = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.DisplayText (string )| -  Display the text. Four virtual methods exist, depending on the type of
 message to display. This allows redirection or reformatting of the
 messages. The default implementation uses DisplayText for all.

\item  \verb|obj.DisplayErrorText (string )| -  Display the text. Four virtual methods exist, depending on the type of
 message to display. This allows redirection or reformatting of the
 messages. The default implementation uses DisplayText for all.

\item  \verb|obj.DisplayWarningText (string )| -  Display the text. Four virtual methods exist, depending on the type of
 message to display. This allows redirection or reformatting of the
 messages. The default implementation uses DisplayText for all.

\item  \verb|obj.DisplayGenericWarningText (string )| -  Display the text. Four virtual methods exist, depending on the type of
 message to display. This allows redirection or reformatting of the
 messages. The default implementation uses DisplayText for all.

\item  \verb|obj.DisplayDebugText (string )|

\item  \verb|obj.PromptUserOn ()| -  If PromptUser is set to true then each time a line of text
 is displayed, the user is asked if they want to keep getting
 messages.

\item  \verb|obj.PromptUserOff ()| -  If PromptUser is set to true then each time a line of text
 is displayed, the user is asked if they want to keep getting
 messages.

\item  \verb|obj.SetPromptUser (int )| -  If PromptUser is set to true then each time a line of text
 is displayed, the user is asked if they want to keep getting
 messages.
