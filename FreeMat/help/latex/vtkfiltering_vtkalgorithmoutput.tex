\section{vtkAlgorithmOutput}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkAlgorithmOutput is a proxy object returned by the GetOutputPort
 method of vtkAlgorithm.  It may be passed to the
 SetInputConnection, AddInputConnection, or RemoveInputConnection
 methods of another vtkAlgorithm to establish a connection between
 an output and input port.  The connection is not stored in the
 proxy object: it is simply a convenience for creating or removing
 connections.

To create an instance of class vtkAlgorithmOutput, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkAlgorithmOutput
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkAlgorithmOutput has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkAlgorithmOutput class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkAlgorithmOutput = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkAlgorithmOutput = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetIndex (int index)|

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetIndex ()|

\item  \verb|vtkAlgorithm = obj.GetProducer ()|

\item  \verb|obj.SetProducer (vtkAlgorithm producer)|

\end{itemize}
