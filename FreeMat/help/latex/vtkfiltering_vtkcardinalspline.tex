In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkCardinalSpline class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkCardinalSpline = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkCardinalSpline = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.Compute ()|

\item  \verb|double = obj.Evaluate (double t)| -  Evaluate a 1D cardinal spline.

\item  \verb|obj.DeepCopy (vtkSpline s)| -  Deep copy of cardinal spline data.

\end{itemize}
