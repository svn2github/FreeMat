\section{vtkGenericCell}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkGenericCell is a class that provides access to concrete types of cells.
 It's main purpose is to allow thread-safe access to cells, supporting
 the vtkDataSet::GetCell(vtkGenericCell *) method. vtkGenericCell acts
 like any type of cell, it just dereferences an internal representation.
 The SetCellType() methods use \#define constants; these are defined in
 the file vtkCellType.h.

To create an instance of class vtkGenericCell, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkGenericCell
\end{verbatim}
