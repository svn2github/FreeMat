\section{vtkImplicitSum}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkImplicitSum produces a linear combination of other implicit functions.
 The contribution of each function is weighted by a scalar coefficient.
 The NormalizeByWeight option normalizes the output so that the
 scalar weights add up to 1. Note that this function gives accurate
 sums and gradients only if the input functions are linear.

To create an instance of class vtkImplicitSum, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkImplicitSum
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkImplicitSum has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkImplicitSum class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkImplicitSum = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkImplicitSum = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|double = obj.EvaluateFunction (double x[3])| -  Evaluate implicit function using current functions and weights.

\item  \verb|double = obj.EvaluateFunction (double x, double y, double z)| -  Evaluate implicit function using current functions and weights.

\item  \verb|obj.EvaluateGradient (double x[3], double g[3])| -  Evaluate gradient of the weighted sum of functions.  Input functions
 should be linear.

\item  \verb|long = obj.GetMTime ()| -  Override modified time retrieval because of object dependencies.

\item  \verb|obj.AddFunction (vtkImplicitFunction in, double weight)| -  Add another implicit function to the list of functions, along with a
 weighting factor.

\item  \verb|obj.AddFunction (vtkImplicitFunction in)| -  Remove all functions from the list.

\item  \verb|obj.RemoveAllFunctions ()| -  Remove all functions from the list.

\item  \verb|obj.SetFunctionWeight (vtkImplicitFunction f, double weight)| -  Set the weight (coefficient) of the given function to be weight.

\item  \verb|obj.SetNormalizeByWeight (int )| -  When calculating the function and gradient values of the
 composite function, setting NormalizeByWeight on will divide the
 final result by the total weight of the component functions.
 This process does not otherwise normalize the gradient vector.
 By default, NormalizeByWeight is off.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetNormalizeByWeight ()| -  When calculating the function and gradient values of the
 composite function, setting NormalizeByWeight on will divide the
 final result by the total weight of the component functions.
 This process does not otherwise normalize the gradient vector.
 By default, NormalizeByWeight is off.

\item  \verb|obj.NormalizeByWeightOn ()| -  When calculating the function and gradient values of the
 composite function, setting NormalizeByWeight on will divide the
 final result by the total weight of the component functions.
 This process does not otherwise normalize the gradient vector.
 By default, NormalizeByWeight is off.

\item  \verb|obj.NormalizeByWeightOff ()| -  When calculating the function and gradient values of the
 composite function, setting NormalizeByWeight on will divide the
 final result by the total weight of the component functions.
 This process does not otherwise normalize the gradient vector.
 By default, NormalizeByWeight is off.
