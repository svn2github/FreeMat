\section{vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey is used to represent keys in
 vtkInformation for values that are vectors of vtkExecutive
 instances paired with port numbers.

To create an instance of class vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey = obj.(string name, string location)|

\item  \verb|~vtkInformationExecutivePortVectorKey = obj.()|

\item  \verb|obj.Append (vtkInformation info, vtkExecutive executive, int port)| -  Get/Set the value associated with this key in the given
 information object.

\item  \verb|obj.Remove (vtkInformation info, vtkExecutive executive, int port)| -  Get/Set the value associated with this key in the given
 information object.

\item  \verb|int = obj.Length (vtkInformation info)| -  Get/Set the value associated with this key in the given
 information object.

\item  \verb|obj.ShallowCopy (vtkInformation from, vtkInformation to)| -  Copy the entry associated with this key from one information
 object to another.  If there is no entry in the first information
 object for this key, the value is removed from the second.

\item  \verb|obj.Remove (vtkInformation info)| -  Remove this key from the given information object.

\item  \verb|obj.Report (vtkInformation info, vtkGarbageCollector collector)| -  Report a reference this key has in the given information object.

\end{itemize}
