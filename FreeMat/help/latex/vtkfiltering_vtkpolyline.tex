\section{vtkPolyLine}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkPolyLine is a concrete implementation of vtkCell to represent a set
 of 1D lines.

To create an instance of class vtkPolyLine, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkPolyLine
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkPolyLine has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkPolyLine class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|
