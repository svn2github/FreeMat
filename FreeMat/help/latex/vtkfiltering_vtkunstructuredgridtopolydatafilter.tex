\section{vtkUnstructuredGridToPolyDataFilter}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkUnstructuredGridToPolyDataFilter is an abstract filter class whose
 subclasses take as input datasets of type vtkUnstructuredGrid and 
 generate polygonal data on output.

To create an instance of class vtkUnstructuredGridToPolyDataFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkUnstructuredGridToPolyDataFilter
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}
