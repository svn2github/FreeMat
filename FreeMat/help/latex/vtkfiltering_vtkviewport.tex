\section{vtkViewport}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkViewport provides an abstract specification for Viewports. A Viewport
 is an object that controls the rendering process for objects. Rendering
 is the process of converting geometry, a specification for lights, and
 a camera view into an image. vtkViewport also performs coordinate
 transformation between world coordinates, view coordinates (the computer
 graphics rendering coordinate system), and display coordinates (the
 actual screen coordinates on the display device). Certain advanced
 rendering features such as two-sided lighting can also be controlled.

To create an instance of class vtkViewport, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkViewport
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkViewport has several methods that can be used.
