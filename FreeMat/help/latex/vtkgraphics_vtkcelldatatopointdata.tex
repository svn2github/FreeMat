\section{vtkCellDataToPointData}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkCellDataToPointData is a filter that transforms cell data (i.e., data
 specified per cell) into point data (i.e., data specified at cell
 points). The method of transformation is based on averaging the data
 values of all cells using a particular point. Optionally, the input cell
 data can be passed through to the output as well.

To create an instance of class vtkCellDataToPointData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkCellDataToPointData
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkCellDataToPointData has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkCellDataToPointData class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkCellDataToPointData = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkCellDataToPointData = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetPassCellData (int )| -  Control whether the input cell data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input cell data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetPassCellData ()| -  Control whether the input cell data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input cell data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\item  \verb|obj.PassCellDataOn ()| -  Control whether the input cell data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input cell data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\item  \verb|obj.PassCellDataOff ()| -  Control whether the input cell data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input cell data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\end{itemize}
