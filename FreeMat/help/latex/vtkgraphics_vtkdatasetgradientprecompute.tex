\section{vtkDataSetGradientPrecompute}

\subsection{Usage}

 Computes a geometry based vector field that the DataSetGradient filter uses to accelerate
 gradient computation. This vector field is added to FieldData since it has a different
 value for each vertex of each cell (a vertex shared by two cell has two differents values).

To create an instance of class vtkDataSetGradientPrecompute, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkDataSetGradientPrecompute
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkDataSetGradientPrecompute has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
