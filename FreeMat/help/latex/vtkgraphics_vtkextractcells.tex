\section{vtkExtractCells}

\subsection{Usage}

    Given a vtkDataSet and a list of cell Ids, create a vtkUnstructuredGrid
    composed of these cells.  If the cell list is empty when vtkExtractCells 
    executes, it will set up the ugrid, point and cell arrays, with no points, 
    cells or data.

To create an instance of class vtkExtractCells, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkExtractCells
\end{verbatim}
