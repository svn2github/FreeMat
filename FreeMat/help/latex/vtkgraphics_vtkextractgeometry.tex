\section{vtkExtractGeometry}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkExtractGeometry extracts from its input dataset all cells that are either
 completely inside or outside of a specified implicit function. Any type of
 dataset can be input to this filter. On output the filter generates an
 unstructured grid.

 To use this filter you must specify an implicit function. You must also
 specify whethter to extract cells lying inside or outside of the implicit 
 function. (The inside of an implicit function is the negative values 
 region.) An option exists to extract cells that are neither inside or
 outside (i.e., boundary).

 A more efficient version of this filter is available for vtkPolyData input.
 See vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry.

To create an instance of class vtkExtractGeometry, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkExtractGeometry
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkExtractGeometry has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkExtractGeometry class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkExtractGeometry = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkExtractGeometry = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|long = obj.GetMTime ()| -  Return the MTime taking into account changes to the implicit function

\item  \verb|obj.SetImplicitFunction (vtkImplicitFunction )| -  Specify the implicit function for inside/outside checks.

\item  \verb|vtkImplicitFunction = obj.GetImplicitFunction ()| -  Specify the implicit function for inside/outside checks.

\item  \verb|obj.SetExtractInside (int )| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetExtractInside ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).

\item  \verb|obj.ExtractInsideOn ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).

\item  \verb|obj.ExtractInsideOff ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are inside of implicit 
 function (ExtractInside == 1) or outside of implicit function 
 (ExtractInside == 0).

\item  \verb|obj.SetExtractBoundaryCells (int )| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetExtractBoundaryCells ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\item  \verb|obj.ExtractBoundaryCellsOn ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\item  \verb|obj.ExtractBoundaryCellsOff ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\item  \verb|obj.SetExtractOnlyBoundaryCells (int )| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetExtractOnlyBoundaryCells ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\item  \verb|obj.ExtractOnlyBoundaryCellsOn ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\item  \verb|obj.ExtractOnlyBoundaryCellsOff ()| -  Boolean controls whether to extract cells that are partially inside.
 By default, ExtractBoundaryCells is off.

\end{itemize}
