\section{vtkExtractTensorComponents}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkExtractTensorComponents is a filter that extracts components of
 a tensor to create a scalar, vector, normal, or texture coords. For
 example, if the tensor contains components of stress, then you
 could extract the normal stress in the x-direction as a scalar
 (i.e., tensor component (0,0).
 
 To use this filter, you must set some boolean flags to control
 which data is extracted from the tensors, and whether you want to
 pass the tensor data through to the output. Also, you must specify
 the tensor component(s) for each type of data you want to
 extract. The tensor component(s) is(are) specified using matrix notation
 into a 3x3 matrix. That is, use the (row,column) address to specify
 a particular tensor component; and if the data you are extracting
 requires more than one component, use a list of addresses. (Note
 that the addresses are 0-offset -> (0,0) specifies upper left
 corner of the tensor.)

 There are two optional methods to extract scalar data. You can
 extract the determinant of the tensor, or you can extract the
 effective stress of the tensor. These require that the ivar
 ExtractScalars is on, and the appropriate scalar extraction mode is
 set.

To create an instance of class vtkExtractTensorComponents, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkExtractTensorComponents
\end{verbatim}
