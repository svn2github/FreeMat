\section{vtkGlyphSource2D}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkGlyphSource2D can generate a family of 2D glyphs each of which lies
 in the x-y plane (i.e., the z-coordinate is zero). The class is a helper 
 class to be used with vtkGlyph2D and vtkXYPlotActor.

 To use this class, specify the glyph type to use and its
 attributes. Attributes include its position (i.e., center point), scale,
 color, and whether the symbol is filled or not (a polygon or closed line
 sequence). You can also put a short line through the glyph running from -x
 to +x (the glyph looks like it's on a line), or a cross.

To create an instance of class vtkGlyphSource2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkGlyphSource2D
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkGlyphSource2D has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkGlyphSource2D class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkGlyphSource2D = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkGlyphSource2D = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetCenter (double , double , double )| -  Set the center of the glyph. By default the center is (0,0,0).

\item  \verb|obj.SetCenter (double  a[3])| -  Set the center of the glyph. By default the center is (0,0,0).

\item  \verb|double = obj. GetCenter ()| -  Set the center of the glyph. By default the center is (0,0,0).

\item  \verb|obj.SetScale (double )| -  Set the scale of the glyph. Note that the glyphs are designed
 to fit in the (1,1) rectangle.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScaleMinValue ()| -  Set the scale of the glyph. Note that the glyphs are designed
 to fit in the (1,1) rectangle.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScaleMaxValue ()| -  Set the scale of the glyph. Note that the glyphs are designed
 to fit in the (1,1) rectangle.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScale ()| -  Set the scale of the glyph. Note that the glyphs are designed
 to fit in the (1,1) rectangle.

\item  \verb|obj.SetScale2 (double )| -  Set the scale of optional portions of the glyph (e.g., the
 dash and cross is DashOn() and CrossOn()).

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScale2MinValue ()| -  Set the scale of optional portions of the glyph (e.g., the
 dash and cross is DashOn() and CrossOn()).

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScale2MaxValue ()| -  Set the scale of optional portions of the glyph (e.g., the
 dash and cross is DashOn() and CrossOn()).

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScale2 ()| -  Set the scale of optional portions of the glyph (e.g., the
 dash and cross is DashOn() and CrossOn()).

\item  \verb|obj.SetColor (double , double , double )| -  Set the color of the glyph. The default color is white.

\item  \verb|obj.SetColor (double  a[3])| -  Set the color of the glyph. The default color is white.

\item  \verb|double = obj. GetColor ()| -  Set the color of the glyph. The default color is white.

\item  \verb|obj.SetFilled (int )| -  Specify whether the glyph is filled (a polygon) or not (a
 closed polygon defined by line segments). This only applies
 to 2D closed glyphs.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetFilled ()| -  Specify whether the glyph is filled (a polygon) or not (a
 closed polygon defined by line segments). This only applies
 to 2D closed glyphs.

\item  \verb|obj.FilledOn ()| -  Specify whether the glyph is filled (a polygon) or not (a
 closed polygon defined by line segments). This only applies
 to 2D closed glyphs.

\item  \verb|obj.FilledOff ()| -  Specify whether the glyph is filled (a polygon) or not (a
 closed polygon defined by line segments). This only applies
 to 2D closed glyphs.

\item  \verb|obj.SetDash (int )| -  Specify whether a short line segment is drawn through the
 glyph. (This is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type
 is set to ''Dash'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetDash ()| -  Specify whether a short line segment is drawn through the
 glyph. (This is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type
 is set to ''Dash'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|obj.DashOn ()| -  Specify whether a short line segment is drawn through the
 glyph. (This is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type
 is set to ''Dash'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|obj.DashOff ()| -  Specify whether a short line segment is drawn through the
 glyph. (This is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type
 is set to ''Dash'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|obj.SetCross (int )| -  Specify whether a cross is drawn as part of the glyph. (This 
 is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type is set to 
 ''Cross'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetCross ()| -  Specify whether a cross is drawn as part of the glyph. (This 
 is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type is set to 
 ''Cross'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|obj.CrossOn ()| -  Specify whether a cross is drawn as part of the glyph. (This 
 is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type is set to 
 ''Cross'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|obj.CrossOff ()| -  Specify whether a cross is drawn as part of the glyph. (This 
 is in addition to the glyph. If the glyph type is set to 
 ''Cross'' there is no need to enable this flag.)

\item  \verb|obj.SetRotationAngle (double )| -  Specify an angle (in degrees) to rotate the glyph around
 the z-axis. Using this ivar, it is possible to generate
 rotated glyphs (e.g., crosses, arrows, etc.)

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetRotationAngle ()| -  Specify an angle (in degrees) to rotate the glyph around
 the z-axis. Using this ivar, it is possible to generate
 rotated glyphs (e.g., crosses, arrows, etc.)
