\section{vtkGraphToPoints}

\subsection{Usage}

 Converts a vtkGraph to a vtkPolyData containing a set of points.

 The vertex data is passed along to the point data.

To create an instance of class vtkGraphToPoints, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkGraphToPoints
\end{verbatim}
