\section{vtkMaskFields}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkMaskFields is used to mark which fields in the input dataset
 get copied to the output.  The output will contain only those fields
 marked as on by the filter.

To create an instance of class vtkMaskFields, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkMaskFields
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkMaskFields has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkMaskFields class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkMaskFields = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkMaskFields = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.CopyFieldOn (int fieldLocation, string name)| -  Turn on/off the copying of the field or specified by name.
 During the copying/passing, the following rules are followed for each
 array:
 1. If the copy flag for an array is set (on or off), it is applied
    This overrides rule 2.
 2. If CopyAllOn is set, copy the array.
    If CopyAllOff is set, do not copy the array
 A field name and a location must be specified. For example:
 @verbatim
 maskFields->CopyFieldOff(vtkMaskFields::CELL\_DATA, ''foo'');
 @endverbatim
 causes the field ''foo'' on the input cell data to not get copied
 to the output.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyFieldOff (int fieldLocation, string name)| -  Turn on/off the copying of the attribute or specified by vtkDataSetAttributes:AttributeTypes.
 During the copying/passing, the following rules are followed for each
 array:
 1. If the copy flag for an array is set (on or off), it is applied
    This overrides rule 2.
 2. If CopyAllOn is set, copy the array.
    If CopyAllOff is set, do not copy the array
 An attribute type and a location must be specified. For example:
 @verbatim
 maskFields->CopyAttributeOff(vtkMaskFields::POINT\_DATA, vtkDataSetAttributes::SCALARS);
 @endverbatim
 causes the scalars on the input point data to not get copied
 to the output.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAttributeOn (int attributeLocation, int attributeType)| -  Turn on/off the copying of the attribute or specified by vtkDataSetAttributes:AttributeTypes.
 During the copying/passing, the following rules are followed for each
 array:
 1. If the copy flag for an array is set (on or off), it is applied
    This overrides rule 2.
 2. If CopyAllOn is set, copy the array.
    If CopyAllOff is set, do not copy the array
 An attribute type and a location must be specified. For example:
 @verbatim
 maskFields->CopyAttributeOff(vtkMaskFields::POINT\_DATA, vtkDataSetAttributes::SCALARS);
 @endverbatim
 causes the scalars on the input point data to not get copied
 to the output.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAttributeOff (int attributeLocation, int attributeType)| -  Convenience methods which operate on all field data or 
 attribute data.  More specific than CopyAllOn or CopyAllOff

\item  \verb|obj.CopyFieldsOff ()| -  Convenience methods which operate on all field data or 
 attribute data.  More specific than CopyAllOn or CopyAllOff

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAttributesOff ()|

\item  \verb|obj.CopyFieldsOn ()|

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAttributesOn ()| -  Helper methods used by other language bindings. Allows the caller to
 specify arguments as strings instead of enums.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAttributeOn (string attributeLoc, string attributeType)| -  Helper methods used by other language bindings. Allows the caller to
 specify arguments as strings instead of enums.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAttributeOff (string attributeLoc, string attributeType)| -  Helper methods used by other language bindings. Allows the caller to
 specify arguments as strings instead of enums.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyFieldOn (string fieldLoc, string name)| -  Helper methods used by other language bindings. Allows the caller to
 specify arguments as strings instead of enums.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyFieldOff (string fieldLoc, string name)| -  Helper methods used by other language bindings. Allows the caller to
 specify arguments as strings instead of enums.

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAllOn ()| -  Turn on copying of all data.
 During the copying/passing, the following rules are followed for each
 array:
 1. If the copy flag for an array is set (on or off), it is applied
    This overrides rule 2.
 2. If CopyAllOn is set, copy the array.
    If CopyAllOff is set, do not copy the array

\item  \verb|obj.CopyAllOff ()| -  Turn off copying of all data.
 During the copying/passing, the following rules are followed for each
 array:
 1. If the copy flag for an array is set (on or off), it is applied
    This overrides rule 2.
 2. If CopyAllOn is set, copy the array.
    If CopyAllOff is set, do not copy the array

\end{itemize}
