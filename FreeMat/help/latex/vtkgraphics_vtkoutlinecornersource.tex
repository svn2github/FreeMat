\subsection{Usage}

 vtkOutlineCornerSource creates wireframe outline corners around a user-specified 
 bounding box.

To create an instance of class vtkOutlineCornerSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkOutlineCornerSource
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkOutlineCornerSource has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,

In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkOutlineCornerSource class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkOutlineCornerSource = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkOutlineCornerSource = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetCornerFactor (double )| -  Set/Get the factor that controls the relative size of the corners
 to the length of the corresponding bounds

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetCornerFactorMinValue ()| -  Set/Get the factor that controls the relative size of the corners
 to the length of the corresponding bounds

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetCornerFactorMaxValue ()| -  Set/Get the factor that controls the relative size of the corners
 to the length of the corresponding bounds

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetCornerFactor ()| -  Set/Get the factor that controls the relative size of the corners
 to the length of the corresponding bounds

\end{itemize}
