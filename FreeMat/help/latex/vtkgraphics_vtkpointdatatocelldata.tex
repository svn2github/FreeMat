\section{vtkPointDataToCellData}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkPointDataToCellData is a filter that transforms point data (i.e., data
 specified per point) into cell data (i.e., data specified per cell).
 The method of transformation is based on averaging the data
 values of all points defining a particular cell. Optionally, the input point
 data can be passed through to the output as well.

To create an instance of class vtkPointDataToCellData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkPointDataToCellData
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkPointDataToCellData has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkPointDataToCellData class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkPointDataToCellData = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkPointDataToCellData = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetPassPointData (int )| -  Control whether the input point data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input point data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetPassPointData ()| -  Control whether the input point data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input point data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\item  \verb|obj.PassPointDataOn ()| -  Control whether the input point data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input point data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\item  \verb|obj.PassPointDataOff ()| -  Control whether the input point data is to be passed to the output. If
 on, then the input point data is passed through to the output; otherwise,
 only generated point data is placed into the output.

\end{itemize}
