\section{vtkPolyDataPointSampler}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkPolyDataPointSampler generates points from input vtkPolyData. The
 points are placed approximately a specified distance apart.

 This filter functions as follows. First, it regurgitates all input points,
 then samples all lines, plus edges associated with the input polygons and
 triangle strips to produce edge points. Finally, the interiors of polygons
 and triangle strips are subsampled to produce points.  All of these
 functiona can be enabled or disabled separately. Note that this algorithm
 only approximately generates points the specified distance apart. 
 Generally the point density is finer than requested.


To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataPointSampler, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkPolyDataPointSampler
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkPolyDataPointSampler has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkPolyDataPointSampler class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()| -  Standard macros for type information and printing.

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)| -  Standard macros for type information and printing.

\item  \verb|vtkPolyDataPointSampler = obj.NewInstance ()| -  Standard macros for type information and printing.

\item  \verb|vtkPolyDataPointSampler = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)| -  Standard macros for type information and printing.

\item  \verb|obj.SetDistance (double )| -  Set/Get the approximate distance between points. This is an absolute
 distance measure. The default is 0.01.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetDistanceMinValue ()| -  Set/Get the approximate distance between points. This is an absolute
 distance measure. The default is 0.01.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetDistanceMaxValue ()| -  Set/Get the approximate distance between points. This is an absolute
 distance measure. The default is 0.01.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetDistance ()| -  Set/Get the approximate distance between points. This is an absolute
 distance measure. The default is 0.01.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetGenerateVertexPoints ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertex points should
 be output.

\item  \verb|obj.SetGenerateVertexPoints (int )| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertex points should
 be output.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateVertexPointsOn ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertex points should
 be output.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateVertexPointsOff ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertex points should
 be output.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetGenerateEdgePoints ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell edges should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.SetGenerateEdgePoints (int )| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell edges should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateEdgePointsOn ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell edges should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateEdgePointsOff ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell edges should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetGenerateInteriorPoints ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell interiors should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.SetGenerateInteriorPoints (int )| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell interiors should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateInteriorPointsOn ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell interiors should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateInteriorPointsOff ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell interiors should
 be sampled to produce output points. The default is true.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetGenerateVertices ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertices should
 be generated. Cell vertices are useful if you actually want to display
 the points (that is, for each point generated, a vertex is generated).
 Recall that VTK only renders vertices and not points. 
 The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.SetGenerateVertices (int )| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertices should
 be generated. Cell vertices are useful if you actually want to display
 the points (that is, for each point generated, a vertex is generated).
 Recall that VTK only renders vertices and not points. 
 The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateVerticesOn ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertices should
 be generated. Cell vertices are useful if you actually want to display
 the points (that is, for each point generated, a vertex is generated).
 Recall that VTK only renders vertices and not points. 
 The default is true.

\item  \verb|obj.GenerateVerticesOff ()| -  Specify/retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether cell vertices should
 be generated. Cell vertices are useful if you actually want to display
 the points (that is, for each point generated, a vertex is generated).
