\section{vtkRibbonFilter}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkRibbonFilter is a filter to create oriented ribbons from lines defined
 in polygonal dataset. The orientation of the ribbon is along the line 
 segments and perpendicular to ''projected'' line normals. Projected line 
 normals are the original line normals projected to be perpendicular to 
 the local line segment. An offset angle can be specified to rotate the 
 ribbon with respect to the normal.


To create an instance of class vtkRibbonFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkRibbonFilter
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkRibbonFilter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetWidthFactor ()| -  Set the maximum ribbon width in terms of a multiple of the minimum width.
 The default is 2.0

\item  \verb|obj.SetDefaultNormal (double , double , double )| -  Set the default normal to use if no normals are supplied, and
 DefaultNormalOn is set. The default is (0,0,1)

\item  \verb|obj.SetDefaultNormal (double  a[3])| -  Set the default normal to use if no normals are supplied, and
 DefaultNormalOn is set. The default is (0,0,1)

\item  \verb|double = obj. GetDefaultNormal ()| -  Set the default normal to use if no normals are supplied, and
 DefaultNormalOn is set. The default is (0,0,1)

\item  \verb|obj.SetUseDefaultNormal (int )| -  Set a boolean to control whether to use default normals.
 The default is Off

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetUseDefaultNormal ()| -  Set a boolean to control whether to use default normals.
 The default is Off

\item  \verb|obj.UseDefaultNormalOn ()| -  Set a boolean to control whether to use default normals.
 The default is Off

\item  \verb|obj.UseDefaultNormalOff ()| -  Set a boolean to control whether to use default normals.
 The default is Off

\item  \verb|obj.SetGenerateTCoords (int )| -  Control whether and how texture coordinates are produced. This is
 useful for striping the ribbon with time textures, etc.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetGenerateTCoordsMinValue ()| -  Control whether and how texture coordinates are produced. This is
 useful for striping the ribbon with time textures, etc.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetGenerateTCoordsMaxValue ()| -  Control whether and how texture coordinates are produced. This is
 useful for striping the ribbon with time textures, etc.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetGenerateTCoords ()| -  Control whether and how texture coordinates are produced. This is
 useful for striping the ribbon with time textures, etc.

\item  \verb|obj.SetGenerateTCoordsToOff ()| -  Control whether and how texture coordinates are produced. This is
 useful for striping the ribbon with time textures, etc.

\item  \verb|obj.SetGenerateTCoordsToNormalizedLength ()| -  Control whether and how texture coordinates are produced. This is
 useful for striping the ribbon with time textures, etc.

 texture space. The default is 1.0

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetTextureLengthMinValue ()| -  Control the conversion of units during the texture coordinates
 calculation. The TextureLength indicates what length (whether 
 calculated from scalars or length) is mapped to the [0,1)
 texture space. The default is 1.0

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetTextureLengthMaxValue ()| -  Control the conversion of units during the texture coordinates
 calculation. The TextureLength indicates what length (whether 
 calculated from scalars or length) is mapped to the [0,1)
 texture space. The default is 1.0
