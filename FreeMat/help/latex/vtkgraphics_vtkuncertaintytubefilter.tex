\section{vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter is a filter that generates ellipsoidal (in cross
 section) tubes that follows a polyline. The input is a vtkPolyData with
 polylines that have associated vector point data. The vector data represents
 the uncertainty of the polyline in the x-y-z directions.


To create an instance of class vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter has several methods that can be used.
