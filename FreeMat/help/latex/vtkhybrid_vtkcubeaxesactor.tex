\section{vtkCubeAxesActor}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkCubeAxesActor is a composite actor that draws axes of the 
 bounding box of an input dataset. The axes include labels and titles
 for the x-y-z axes. The algorithm selects which axes to draw based
 on the user-defined 'fly' mode.  (STATIC is default).
 'STATIC' constructs axes from all edges of the bounding box.
 'CLOSEST\_TRIAD' consists of the three axes x-y-z forming a triad that 
 lies closest to the specified camera. 
 'FURTHEST\_TRIAD' consists of the three axes x-y-z forming a triad that 
 lies furthest from the specified camera. 
 'OUTER\_EDGES' is constructed from edges that are on the ''exterior'' of the 
 bounding box, exterior as determined from examining outer edges of the 
 bounding box in projection (display) space. 
 
 To use this object you must define a bounding box and the camera used
 to render the vtkCubeAxesActor. You can optionally turn on/off labels,
 ticks, gridlines, and set tick location, number of labels, and text to
 use for axis-titles.  A 'corner offset' can also be set.  This allows 
 the axes to be set partially away from the actual bounding box to perhaps
 prevent overlap of labels between the various axes.

 The Bounds instance variable (an array of six doubles) is used to determine
 the bounding box.
 

To create an instance of class vtkCubeAxesActor, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkCubeAxesActor
\end{verbatim}
