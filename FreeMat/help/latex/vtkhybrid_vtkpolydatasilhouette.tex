\section{vtkPolyDataSilhouette}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkPolyDataSilhouette extracts a subset of a polygonal mesh edges to
 generate an outline (silhouette) of the corresponding 3D object. In
 addition, this filter can also extracts sharp edges (aka feature angles).
 In order to use this filter you must specify the a point of view (origin) or
 a direction (vector).  given this direction or origin, a silhouette is
 generated wherever the surface's normal is orthogonal to the view direction.


To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataSilhouette, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkPolyDataSilhouette
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkPolyDataSilhouette has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkPolyDataSilhouette class.

 multi-block data sets. Note: requires one level of ghost cells

\item  \verb|obj.SetDirection (int )| -  Specify how view direction is computed. By default, the
 camera origin (eye) is used.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetDirection ()| -  Specify how view direction is computed. By default, the
 camera origin (eye) is used.

\item  \verb|obj.SetDirectionToSpecifiedVector ()| -  Specify how view direction is computed. By default, the
 camera origin (eye) is used.

\item  \verb|obj.SetDirectionToSpecifiedOrigin ()| -  Specify how view direction is computed. By default, the
 camera origin (eye) is used.

\item  \verb|obj.SetDirectionToCameraVector ()| -  Specify how view direction is computed. By default, the
 camera origin (eye) is used.

\item  \verb|obj.SetDirectionToCameraOrigin ()| -  Specify a camera that is used to define the view direction.  This ivar
 only has effect if the direction is set to VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_ORIGIN or
 VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_VECTOR, and a camera is specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetCamera (vtkCamera )| -  Specify a camera that is used to define the view direction.  This ivar
 only has effect if the direction is set to VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_ORIGIN or
 VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_VECTOR, and a camera is specified.

\item  \verb|vtkCamera = obj.GetCamera ()| -  Specify a camera that is used to define the view direction.  This ivar
 only has effect if the direction is set to VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_ORIGIN or
 VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_VECTOR, and a camera is specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetProp3D (vtkProp3D )| -  Specify a transformation matrix (via the vtkProp3D::GetMatrix() method)
 that is used to include the effects of transformation. This ivar only has
 effect if the direction is set to VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_ORIGIN or
 VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_VECTOR, and a camera is specified. Specifying the
 vtkProp3D is optional.

\item  \verb|vtkProp3D = obj.GetProp3D ()| -  Specify a transformation matrix (via the vtkProp3D::GetMatrix() method)
 that is used to include the effects of transformation. This ivar only has
 effect if the direction is set to VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_ORIGIN or
 VTK\_DIRECTION\_CAMERA\_VECTOR, and a camera is specified. Specifying the
 vtkProp3D is optional.

\item  \verb|obj.SetVector (double , double , double )| -  Set/Get the sort direction. This ivar only has effect if the sort
 direction is set to SetDirectionToSpecifiedVector(). The edge detection
 occurs in the direction of the vector.

\item  \verb|obj.SetVector (double  a[3])| -  Set/Get the sort direction. This ivar only has effect if the sort
 direction is set to SetDirectionToSpecifiedVector(). The edge detection
 occurs in the direction of the vector.

\item  \verb|double = obj. GetVector ()| -  Set/Get the sort direction. This ivar only has effect if the sort
 direction is set to SetDirectionToSpecifiedVector(). The edge detection
 occurs in the direction of the vector.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOrigin (double , double , double )| -  Set/Get the sort origin. This ivar only has effect if the sort direction
 is set to SetDirectionToSpecifiedOrigin(). The edge detection occurs in
 the direction of the origin to each edge's center.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOrigin (double  a[3])| -  Set/Get the sort origin. This ivar only has effect if the sort direction
 is set to SetDirectionToSpecifiedOrigin(). The edge detection occurs in
 the direction of the origin to each edge's center.
