\section{vtkImageClip}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkImageClip  will make an image smaller.  The output must have
 an image extent which is the subset of the input.  The filter has two 
 modes of operation: 
 1: By default, the data is not copied in this filter. 
 Only the whole extent is modified.  
 2: If ClipDataOn is set, then you will get no more that the clipped
 extent.

To create an instance of class vtkImageClip, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkImageClip
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkImageClip has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkImageClip class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkImageClip = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkImageClip = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputWholeExtent (int extent[6], vtkInformation outInfo)| -  The whole extent of the output has to be set explicitly.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputWholeExtent (int minX, int maxX, int minY, int maxY, int minZ, int maxZ)| -  The whole extent of the output has to be set explicitly.

\item  \verb|obj.GetOutputWholeExtent (int extent[6])| -  The whole extent of the output has to be set explicitly.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetOutputWholeExtent ()|

\item  \verb|obj.ResetOutputWholeExtent ()|

\item  \verb|obj.SetClipData (int )| -  By default, ClipData is off, and only the WholeExtent is modified.
 the data's extent may actually be larger.  When this flag is on,
 the data extent will be no more than the OutputWholeExtent.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetClipData ()| -  By default, ClipData is off, and only the WholeExtent is modified.
 the data's extent may actually be larger.  When this flag is on,
 the data extent will be no more than the OutputWholeExtent.

\item  \verb|obj.ClipDataOn ()| -  By default, ClipData is off, and only the WholeExtent is modified.
 the data's extent may actually be larger.  When this flag is on,
 the data extent will be no more than the OutputWholeExtent.

\item  \verb|obj.ClipDataOff ()| -  By default, ClipData is off, and only the WholeExtent is modified.
 the data's extent may actually be larger.  When this flag is on,
 the data extent will be no more than the OutputWholeExtent.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputWholeExtent (int piece, int numPieces)| -  Hack set output by piece

\end{itemize}
