\section{vtkImageFourierFilter}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkImageFourierFilter is a class of filters that use complex numbers
 this superclass is a container for methods that manipulate these structure
 including fast Fourier transforms.  Complex numbers may become a class.
 This should really be a helper class.

To create an instance of class vtkImageFourierFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkImageFourierFilter
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkImageFourierFilter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkImageFourierFilter = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkImageFourierFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\end{itemize}
