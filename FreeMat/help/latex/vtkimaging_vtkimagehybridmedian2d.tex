\section{vtkImageHybridMedian2D}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkImageHybridMedian2D is a median filter that preserves thin lines and
 corners.  It operates on a 5x5 pixel neighborhood.  It computes two values
 initially: the median of the + neighbors and the median of the x
 neighbors.  It then computes the median of these two values plus the center
 pixel.  This result of this second median is the output pixel value.

To create an instance of class vtkImageHybridMedian2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkImageHybridMedian2D
\end{verbatim}
