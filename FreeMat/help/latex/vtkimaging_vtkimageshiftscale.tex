\section{vtkImageShiftScale}

\subsection{Usage}

 With vtkImageShiftScale Pixels are shifted (a constant value added)
 and then scaled (multiplied by a scalar. As a convenience, this class 
 allows you to set the output scalar type similar to vtkImageCast. 
 This is because shift scale operations frequently convert data types.

To create an instance of class vtkImageShiftScale, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkImageShiftScale
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkImageShiftScale has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkImageShiftScale class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkImageShiftScale = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkImageShiftScale = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetShift (double )| -  Set/Get the shift value. This value is added to each pixel

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetShift ()| -  Set/Get the shift value. This value is added to each pixel

\item  \verb|obj.SetScale (double )| -  Set/Get the scale value. Each pixel is multiplied by this value.

\item  \verb|double = obj.GetScale ()| -  Set/Get the scale value. Each pixel is multiplied by this value.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarType (int )| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetOutputScalarType ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToDouble ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToFloat ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToLong ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToUnsignedLong ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToInt ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToUnsignedInt ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToShort ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToUnsignedShort ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToChar ()| -  Set the desired output scalar type. The result of the shift 
 and scale operations is cast to the type specified.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutputScalarTypeToUnsignedChar ()| -  When the ClampOverflow flag is on, the data is thresholded so that
 the output value does not exceed the max or min of the data type.
 By default, ClampOverflow is off.

\item  \verb|obj.SetClampOverflow (int )| -  When the ClampOverflow flag is on, the data is thresholded so that
 the output value does not exceed the max or min of the data type.
 By default, ClampOverflow is off.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetClampOverflow ()| -  When the ClampOverflow flag is on, the data is thresholded so that
 the output value does not exceed the max or min of the data type.
 By default, ClampOverflow is off.

\item  \verb|obj.ClampOverflowOn ()| -  When the ClampOverflow flag is on, the data is thresholded so that
 the output value does not exceed the max or min of the data type.
 By default, ClampOverflow is off.

\item  \verb|obj.ClampOverflowOff ()| -  When the ClampOverflow flag is on, the data is thresholded so that
 the output value does not exceed the max or min of the data type.
 By default, ClampOverflow is off.
