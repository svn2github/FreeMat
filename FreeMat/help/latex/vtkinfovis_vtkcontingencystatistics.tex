\section{vtkContingencyStatistics}

\subsection{Usage}

 Given a pair of columns of interest, this class provides the
 following functionalities, depending on the execution mode it is executed in:
 * Learn: calculate contigency tables and corresponding discrete bivariate
   probability distribution. 
 * Assess: given two columns of interest with the same number of entries as
   input in port INPUT\_DATA, and a corresponding bivariate probability distribution,
