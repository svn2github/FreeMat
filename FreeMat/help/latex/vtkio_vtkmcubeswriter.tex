\section{vtkMCubesWriter}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkMCubesWriter is a polydata writer that writes binary marching cubes
 files. (Marching cubes is an isosurfacing technique that generates many
 triangles.) The binary format is supported by W. Lorensen's marching cubes
 program (and the vtkSliceCubes object). Each triangle is represented by
 three records, with each record consisting of six single precision
 floating point numbers representing the a triangle vertex coordinate and
 vertex normal.

To create an instance of class vtkMCubesWriter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkMCubesWriter
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkMCubesWriter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkMCubesWriter class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkMCubesWriter = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkMCubesWriter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetLimitsFileName (string )| -  Set/get file name of marching cubes limits file.

\item  \verb|string = obj.GetLimitsFileName ()| -  Set/get file name of marching cubes limits file.

\end{itemize}
