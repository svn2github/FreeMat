\section{vtkPolyDataReader}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkPolyDataReader is a source object that reads ASCII or binary 
 polygonal data files in vtk format (see text for format details).
 The output of this reader is a single vtkPolyData data object.
 The superclass of this class, vtkDataReader, provides many methods for
 controlling the reading of the data file, see vtkDataReader for more
 information.

To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkPolyDataReader
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkPolyDataReader class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkPolyDataReader = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkPolyDataReader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|vtkPolyData = obj.GetOutput ()| -  Get the output of this reader.

\item  \verb|vtkPolyData = obj.GetOutput (int idx)| -  Get the output of this reader.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOutput (vtkPolyData output)| -  Get the output of this reader.

\end{itemize}
