\section{vtkUnstructuredGridReader}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkUnstructuredGridReader is a source object that reads ASCII or binary 
 unstructured grid data files in vtk format. (see text for format details).
 The output of this reader is a single vtkUnstructuredGrid data object.
 The superclass of this class, vtkDataReader, provides many methods for
 controlling the reading of the data file, see vtkDataReader for more
 information.

To create an instance of class vtkUnstructuredGridReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkUnstructuredGridReader
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}
