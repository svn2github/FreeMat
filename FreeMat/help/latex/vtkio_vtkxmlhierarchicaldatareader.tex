\section{vtkXMLHierarchicalDataReader}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkXMLHierarchicalDataReader reads the VTK XML hierarchical data file
 format. XML hierarchical data files are meta-files that point to a list
 of serial VTK XML files. When reading in parallel, it will distribute
 sub-blocks among processor. If the number of sub-blocks is less than
 the number of processors, some processors will not have any sub-blocks
 for that level. If the number of sub-blocks is larger than the
 number of processors, each processor will possibly have more than
 1 sub-block.

To create an instance of class vtkXMLHierarchicalDataReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkXMLHierarchicalDataReader
\end{verbatim}
