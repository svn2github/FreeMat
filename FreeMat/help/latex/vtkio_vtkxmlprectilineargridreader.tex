\section{vtkXMLPRectilinearGridReader}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkXMLPRectilinearGridReader reads the PVTK XML RectilinearGrid
 file format.  This reads the parallel format's summary file and
 then uses vtkXMLRectilinearGridReader to read data from the
 individual RectilinearGrid piece files.  Streaming is supported.
 The standard extension for this reader's file format is ''pvtr''.

To create an instance of class vtkXMLPRectilinearGridReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkXMLPRectilinearGridReader
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkXMLPRectilinearGridReader = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkXMLPRectilinearGridReader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|vtkRectilinearGrid = obj.GetOutput ()| -  Get the reader's output.

\item  \verb|vtkRectilinearGrid = obj.GetOutput (int idx)| -  Get the reader's output.

\end{itemize}
