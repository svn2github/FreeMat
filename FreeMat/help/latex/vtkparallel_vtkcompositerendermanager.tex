\section{vtkCompositeRenderManager}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkCompositeRenderManager is a subclass of vtkParallelRenderManager that
 uses compositing to do parallel rendering.  This class has
 replaced vtkCompositeManager.


To create an instance of class vtkCompositeRenderManager, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
