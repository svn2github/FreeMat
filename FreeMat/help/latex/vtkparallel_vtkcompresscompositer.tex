\section{vtkCompressCompositer}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkCompressCompositer operates in multiple processes.  Each compositer has 
 a render window.  They use vtkMultiProcessController to communicate 
 the color and depth buffer to process 0's render window.
 It will not handle transparency.  Compositing is run length encoding
 of background pixels.
