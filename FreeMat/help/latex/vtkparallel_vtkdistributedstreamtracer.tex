\section{vtkDistributedStreamTracer}

\subsection{Usage}

 This filter integrates streamlines on a distributed dataset. It is
 essentially a serial algorithm: only one process is active at one
 time and it is not more efficient than a single process integration.
 It is useful when the data is too large to be on one process and
 has to be kept distributed.

To create an instance of class vtkDistributedStreamTracer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkDistributedStreamTracer
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkDistributedStreamTracer has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkDistributedStreamTracer class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkDistributedStreamTracer = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkDistributedStreamTracer = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\end{itemize}
