\section{vtkGPUInfo}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkGPUInfo stores information about GPU Video RAM. An host can have
 several GPUs. The values are set by vtkGPUInfoList.

To create an instance of class vtkGPUInfo, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkGPUInfo
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkGPUInfo has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkGPUInfo class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkGPUInfo = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkGPUInfo = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetDedicatedVideoMemory (vtkIdType )| -  Set/Get dedicated video memory in bytes. Initial value is 0.
 Usually the fastest one. If it is not null, it should be take into
 account first and DedicatedSystemMemory or SharedSystemMemory should be
 ignored.

\item  \verb|vtkIdType = obj.GetDedicatedVideoMemory ()| -  Set/Get dedicated video memory in bytes. Initial value is 0.
 Usually the fastest one. If it is not null, it should be take into
 account first and DedicatedSystemMemory or SharedSystemMemory should be
 ignored.

\item  \verb|obj.SetDedicatedSystemMemory (vtkIdType )| -  Set/Get dedicated system memory in bytes. Initial value is 0.
 This is slow memory. If it is not null, this value should be taken into
 account only if there is no DedicatedVideoMemory and SharedSystemMemory
 should be ignored.

\item  \verb|vtkIdType = obj.GetDedicatedSystemMemory ()| -  Set/Get dedicated system memory in bytes. Initial value is 0.
 This is slow memory. If it is not null, this value should be taken into
 account only if there is no DedicatedVideoMemory and SharedSystemMemory
 should be ignored.

\item  \verb|obj.SetSharedSystemMemory (vtkIdType )| -  Set/Get shared system memory in bytes. Initial value is 0.
 Slowest memory. This value should be taken into account only if there is
 neither DedicatedVideoMemory nor DedicatedSystemMemory.

\item  \verb|vtkIdType = obj.GetSharedSystemMemory ()| -  Set/Get shared system memory in bytes. Initial value is 0.
 Slowest memory. This value should be taken into account only if there is
 neither DedicatedVideoMemory nor DedicatedSystemMemory.

\end{itemize}
