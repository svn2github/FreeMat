\subsection{Usage}

 vtkOBJExporter is a concrete subclass of vtkExporter that writes wavefront
 .OBJ files in ASCII form. It also writes out a mtl file that contains the
 material properties. The filenames are derived by appending the .obj and
 .mtl suffix onto the user specified FilePrefix.


To create an instance of class vtkOBJExporter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkOBJExporter
\end{verbatim}

Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkOBJExporter class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkOBJExporter = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkOBJExporter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|obj.SetFilePrefix (string )| -  Specify the prefix of the files to write out. The resulting filenames
 will have .obj and .mtl appended to them.

\item  \verb|string = obj.GetFilePrefix ()| -  Specify the prefix of the files to write out. The resulting filenames
 will have .obj and .mtl appended to them.

\end{itemize}
