\subsection{Usage}

 vtkStandardPolyDataPainter is a catch-all painter.  It should work with pretty
 much any vtkPolyData, and attributes, and vtkPolyDataPainterDeviceAdapter.  On
 the flip side, the vtkStandardPolyDataPainter will be slower than the more
 special purpose painters.

To create an instance of class vtkStandardPolyDataPainter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkStandardPolyDataPainter
