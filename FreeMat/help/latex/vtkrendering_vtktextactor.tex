\section{vtkTextActor}

\subsection{Usage}

 vtkTextActor can be used to place text annotation into a window.
 When TextScaleMode is NONE, the text is fixed font and operation is
 the same as a vtkPolyDataMapper2D/vtkActor2D pair.
 When TextScaleMode is VIEWPORT, the font resizes such that it maintains a
 consistent size relative to the viewport in which it is rendered.
 When TextScaleMode is PROP, the font resizes such that the text fits inside
 the box defined by the position 1 \& 2 coordinates. This class replaces the
 deprecated vtkScaledTextActor and acts as a convenient wrapper for
 a vtkTextMapper/vtkActor2D pair.
 Set the text property/attributes through the vtkTextProperty associated to
 this actor.


To create an instance of class vtkTextActor, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkTextActor
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkTextActor has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkTextActor class.

\item  \verb|obj.SetTextScaleModeToViewport ()| -  DO NOT CALL.  Deprecated in VTK 5.4.  Use SetTextScaleMode or
 GetTextScaleMode instead.

\item  \verb|obj.SetScaledText (int )| -  DO NOT CALL.  Deprecated in VTK 5.4.  Use SetTextScaleMode or
 GetTextScaleMode instead.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetScaledText ()| -  DO NOT CALL.  Deprecated in VTK 5.4.  Use SetTextScaleMode or

\item  \verb|obj.SetUseBorderAlign (int )| -  Turn on or off the UseBorderAlign option.
 When UseBorderAlign is on, the bounding rectangle is used to align the text,
 which is the proper behavior when using vtkTextRepresentation

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetUseBorderAlign ()| -  Turn on or off the UseBorderAlign option.
 When UseBorderAlign is on, the bounding rectangle is used to align the text,
 which is the proper behavior when using vtkTextRepresentation

 When UseBorderAlign is on, the bounding rectangle is used to align the text,
 which is the proper behavior when using vtkTextRepresentation

\item  \verb|obj.UseBorderAlignOff ()| -  Turn on or off the UseBorderAlign option.
 When UseBorderAlign is on, the bounding rectangle is used to align the text,
 which is the proper behavior when using vtkTextRepresentation

\item  \verb|obj.SetAlignmentPoint (int point)| -  This method is being depricated.  Use SetJustification and
 SetVerticalJustification in text property instead.
 Set/Get the Alignment point
 if zero (default), the text aligns itself to the bottom left corner
 (which is defined by the PositionCoordinate)
 otherwise the text aligns itself to corner/midpoint or centre
 @verbatim
      6   7   8
      3   4   5
      0   1   2
 @endverbatim
 This is the same as setting the TextProperty's justification.
 Currently TextActor is not oriented around its AlignmentPoint.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetAlignmentPoint ()| -  This method is being depricated.  Use SetJustification and
 SetVerticalJustification in text property instead.
 Set/Get the Alignment point
 if zero (default), the text aligns itself to the bottom left corner
 (which is defined by the PositionCoordinate)
 otherwise the text aligns itself to corner/midpoint or centre
 @verbatim
      6   7   8
      3   4   5
      0   1   2
 @endverbatim
 This is the same as setting the TextProperty's justification.
 Currently TextActor is not oriented around its AlignmentPoint.

\item  \verb|obj.SetOrientation (float orientation)| -  Counterclockwise rotation around the Alignment point.  
 Units are in degrees and defaults to 0.
 The orientation in the text property rotates the text in the 
 texture map.  It will proba ly not give you the effect you
 desire.

\item  \verb|float = obj.GetOrientation ()| -  Counterclockwise rotation around the Alignment point.  
 Units are in degrees and defaults to 0.
 The orientation in the text property rotates the text in the 
 texture map.  It will proba ly not give you the effect you
 desire.

\item  \verb|obj.SetTextProperty (vtkTextProperty p)| -  Set/Get the text property.

\item  \verb|vtkTextProperty = obj.GetTextProperty ()| -  Set/Get the text property.

\item  \verb|obj.SetNonLinearFontScale (double exponent, int target)| -  Enable non-linear scaling of font sizes. This is useful in combination
 with scaled text. With small windows you want to use the entire scaled
 text area. With larger windows you want to reduce the font size some so
 that the entire area is not used. These values modify the computed font 
 size as follows:  
   newFontSize = pow(FontSize,exponent)*pow(target,1.0 - exponent)
 typically exponent should be around 0.7 and target should be around 10

\item  \verb|obj.SpecifiedToDisplay (double pos, vtkViewport vport, int specified)| -  This is just a simple coordinate conversion method used in the render
 process.

\item  \verb|obj.DisplayToSpecified (double pos, vtkViewport vport, int specified)| -  This is just a simple coordinate conversion method used in the render
 process.

\item  \verb|obj.ComputeScaledFont (vtkViewport viewport)| -  Compute the scale the font should be given the viewport.  The result
 is placed in the ScaledTextProperty ivar.

\item  \verb|vtkTextProperty = obj.GetScaledTextProperty ()| -  Get the scaled font.  Use ComputeScaledFont to set the scale for a given
 viewport.
