\section{vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper}

\subsection{Usage}

 This is the concrete implementation of a ray cast image display helper -
 a helper class responsible for drawing the image to the screen.

To create an instance of class vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)|

\item  \verb|vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper = obj.NewInstance ()|

\item  \verb|vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)|

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsRenderSupported (vtkRenderWindow window, vtkVolumeProperty property)| -  Based on hardware and properties, we may or may not be able to
 render using 3D texture mapping. This indicates if 3D texture
 mapping is supported by the hardware, and if the other extensions
 necessary to support the specific properties are available.

\end{itemize}
