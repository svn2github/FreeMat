\section{vtkSeedRepresentation}

\subsection{Usage}

 The vtkSeedRepresentation is a superclass for classes representing the
 vtkSeedWidget. This representation consists of one or more handles
 (vtkHandleRepresentation) which are used to place and manipulate the
 points defining the collection of seeds. 

To create an instance of class vtkSeedRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkSeedRepresentation
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Methods}

The class vtkSeedRepresentation has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, \verb|obj| is an instance of the vtkSeedRepresentation class.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|string = obj.GetClassName ()| -  Standard VTK methods.

\item  \verb|int = obj.IsA (string name)| -  Standard VTK methods.

\item  \verb|vtkSeedRepresentation = obj.NewInstance ()| -  Standard VTK methods.

\item  \verb|vtkSeedRepresentation = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)| -  Standard VTK methods.

\item  \verb|obj.GetSeedWorldPosition (int seedNum, double pos[3])| -  Methods to Set/Get the coordinates of seed points defining
 this representation. Note that methods are available for both
 display and world coordinates. The seeds are accessed by a seed
 number.

\item  \verb|obj.SetSeedDisplayPosition (int seedNum, double pos[3])| -  Methods to Set/Get the coordinates of seed points defining
 this representation. Note that methods are available for both
 display and world coordinates. The seeds are accessed by a seed
 number.

\item  \verb|obj.GetSeedDisplayPosition (int seedNum, double pos[3])| -  Methods to Set/Get the coordinates of seed points defining
 this representation. Note that methods are available for both
 display and world coordinates. The seeds are accessed by a seed
 number.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetNumberOfSeeds ()| -  Return the number of seeds (or handles) that have been created.

\item  \verb|obj.SetHandleRepresentation (vtkHandleRepresentation handle)| -  This method is used to specify the type of handle representation to use
 for the internal vtkHandleWidgets within vtkSeedWidget.  To use this
 method, create a dummy vtkHandleWidget (or subclass), and then invoke
 this method with this dummy. Then the vtkSeedRepresentation uses this
 dummy to clone vtkHandleWidgets of the same type. Make sure you set the
 handle representation before the widget is enabled. 

\item  \verb|vtkHandleRepresentation = obj.GetHandleRepresentation (int num)| -  Get the handle representations used for a particular seed. A side effect of
 this method is that it will create a handle representation in the list of
 representations if one has not yet been created.

\item  \verb|vtkHandleRepresentation = obj.GetHandleRepresentation ()| -  Returns the model HandleRepresentation.

\item  \verb|obj.SetTolerance (int )| -  The tolerance representing the distance to the widget (in pixels) in
 which the cursor is considered near enough to the end points of
 the widget to be active.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetToleranceMinValue ()| -  The tolerance representing the distance to the widget (in pixels) in
 which the cursor is considered near enough to the end points of
 the widget to be active.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetToleranceMaxValue ()| -  The tolerance representing the distance to the widget (in pixels) in
 which the cursor is considered near enough to the end points of
 the widget to be active.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetTolerance ()| -  The tolerance representing the distance to the widget (in pixels) in
 which the cursor is considered near enough to the end points of
 the widget to be active.

\item  \verb|int = obj.GetActiveHandle ()| -  These are methods specific to vtkSeedRepresentation and which are
 invoked from vtkSeedWidget.

\item  \verb|int = obj.CreateHandle (double e[2])| -  These are methods specific to vtkSeedRepresentation and which are
 invoked from vtkSeedWidget.

\item  \verb|obj.RemoveLastHandle ()| -  These are methods specific to vtkSeedRepresentation and which are
 invoked from vtkSeedWidget.

\item  \verb|obj.RemoveActiveHandle ()| -  These are methods specific to vtkSeedRepresentation and which are
 invoked from vtkSeedWidget.

\item  \verb|obj.RemoveHandle (int n)| -  Remove the nth handle.

\item  \verb|obj.BuildRepresentation ()| -  These are methods that satisfy vtkWidgetRepresentation's API.

\item  \verb|int = obj.ComputeInteractionState (int X, int Y, int modify)| -  These are methods that satisfy vtkWidgetRepresentation's API.

\end{itemize}
