\section{vtkSphereRepresentation}

\subsection{Usage}

 This class is a concrete representation for the vtkSphereWidget2. It
 represents a sphere with an optional handle.  Through interaction with the
 widget, the sphere can be arbitrarily positioned and scaled in 3D space;
 and the handle can be moved on the surface of the sphere. Typically the
 vtkSphereWidget2/vtkSphereRepresentation are used to position a sphere for
 the purpose of extracting, cutting or clipping data; or the handle is
 moved on the sphere to position a light or camera.

 To use this representation, you normally use the PlaceWidget() method
 to position the widget at a specified region in space. It is also possible
 to set the center of the sphere, a radius, and/or a handle position.


To create an instance of class vtkSphereRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  obj = vtkSphereRepresentation
\end{verbatim}

 InteractionEvent or EndInteraction events are invoked. The user provides
 the vtkPolyData and the points and polysphere are added to it.

 vtkSphere is a subclass of vtkImplicitFunction, meaning that it can be
 used by a variety of filters to perform clipping, cutting, and selection

 other object. This controls how the interaction with the widget
 proceeds. Normally this method is used as part of a handshaking
 process with the widget: First ComputeInteractionState() is invoked that
 returns a state based on geometric considerations (i.e., cursor near a
 widget feature), then based on events, the widget may modify this
 further.
