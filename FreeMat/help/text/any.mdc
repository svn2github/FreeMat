ANY Any True Function

Usage

Reduces a logical array along a given dimension by testing for any
logical 1s.  The general 
syntax for its use is

  y = any(x,d)

where x is an n-dimensions array of logical type.
The output is of logical type.  The argument d is 
optional, and denotes the dimension along which to operate.
The output y is the same size as x, except that it is 
singular along the operated direction.  So, for example,
if x is a 3 x 3 x 4 array, and we any operation along
dimension d=2, then the output is of size 3 x 1 x 4.
