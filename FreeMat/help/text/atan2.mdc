ATAN2 Inverse Trigonometric 4-Quadrant Arctangent Function

Usage

Computes the atan2 function for its argument.  The general
syntax for its use is

  z = atan2(y,x)

where x and y are n-dimensional arrays of numerical type.
Integer types are promoted to the double type prior to
calculation of the atan2 function. The size of the output depends
on the size of x and y.  If x is a scalar, then z
is the same size as y, and if y is a scalar, then z
is the same size as x.  The type of the output is equal to the type of
|y/x|.
