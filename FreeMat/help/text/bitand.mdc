BITAND Bitwise Boolean And Operation

Usage

Performs a bitwise binary and operation on the two arguments and
returns the result.  The syntax for its use is

   y = bitand(a,b)

where a and b are multi-dimensional unsigned integer arrays.
The and operation is performed using 32 bit unsigned intermediates.  Note that if a
or b is a scalar, then each element of the other array is and'ed with
 that scalar.  Otherwise the two arrays must match in size.
