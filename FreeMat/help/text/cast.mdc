CAST Typecast Variable to Specified Type

Usage

The cast function allows you to typecast a variable from one
type to another.  The syntax for its use is 

    y = cast(x,toclass)

where toclass is the name of the class to cast x to.  Note
that the typecast must make sense, and that toclass must be
one of the builtin types.  The current list of supported types is
  -  'cell' for cell-arrays

  -  'struct' for structure-arrays

  -  'logical' for logical arrays

  -  'uint8' for unsigned 8-bit integers

  -  'int8' for signed 8-bit integers

  -  'uint16' for unsigned 16-bit integers

  -  'int16' for signed 16-bit integers

  -  'uint32' for unsigned 32-bit integers

  -  'int32' for signed 32-bit integers

  -  'uint64' for unsigned 64-bit integers

  -  'int64' for signed 64-bit integers

  -  'float' for 32-bit floating point numbers

  -  'single' is a synonym for 'float'

  -  'double' for 64-bit floating point numbers

  -  'char' for string arrays
