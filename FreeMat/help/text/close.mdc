CLOSE Close Figure Window

Usage

Closes a figure window, either the currently active window, a 
window with a specific handle, or all figure windows.  The general
syntax for its use is

   close(handle)

in which case the figure window with the speicified handle is
closed.  Alternately, issuing the command with no argument

   close

is equivalent to closing the currently active figure window.  Finally
the command

   close('all')

closes all figure windows currently open.
