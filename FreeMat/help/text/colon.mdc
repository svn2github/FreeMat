COLON Index Generation Operator

Usage

There are two distinct syntaxes for the colon : operator - the two argument form

  y = a : c

and the three argument form

  y = a : b : c

The two argument form is exactly equivalent to a:1:c.  The output y is the vector
where a+nb <= c.  There is a third form of the colon operator, the 
no-argument form used in indexing (see indexing for more details).
