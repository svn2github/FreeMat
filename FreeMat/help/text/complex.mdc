COMPLEX COMPLEX Create a Complex Number

Usage

Converts the two real input arguments into the real and imaginary part
(respectively) of a complex number.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = complex(x,z)

where x and z are n-dimensional numerical arrays.  The usual rules
for binary operators apply (i.e., one of the arguments can be a scalar,
if either is of type single the output is single, etc.).
