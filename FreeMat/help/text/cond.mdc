COND COND Condition Number of a Matrix

Usage

Calculates the condition number of a matrix.  To compute the
2-norm condition number of a matrix (ratio of largest to smallest
singular values), use the syntax

   y = cond(A)

where A is a matrix.  If you want to compute the condition number
in a different norm (e.g., the 1-norm), use the second syntax

   y = cond(A,p)

where p is the norm to use when computing the condition number.
The following choices of p are supported
  -  p = 1 returns the 1-norm, or the max column sum of A

  -  p = 2 returns the 2-norm (largest singular value of A)

  -  p = inf returns the infinity norm, or the max row sum of A

  -  p = 'fro' returns the Frobenius-norm (vector Euclidean norm, or RMS value)
