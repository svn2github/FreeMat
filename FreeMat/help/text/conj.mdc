CONJ CONJ Conjugate Function

Usage

Returns the complex conjugate of the input array for all elements.  The 
general syntax for its use is

   y = conj(x)

where x is an n-dimensional array of numerical type.  The output 
is the same numerical type as the input.  The conj function does
nothing to real and integer types.
