CONV CONV Convolution Function

Usage

The conv function performs a one-dimensional convolution of two
vector arguments.  The syntax for its use is

     z = conv(x,y)

where x and y are vectors.  The output is of length nx + ny -1.
The conv function calls conv2 to do the calculation.  See its
help for more details.
