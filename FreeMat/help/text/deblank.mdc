DEBLANK DEBLANK Remove trailing blanks from a string

Usage

The deblank function removes spaces at the end of a string
when used with the syntax

   y = deblank(x)

where x is a string, in which case, all of the extra spaces
in x are stripped from the end of the string.  Alternately,
you can call deblank with a cell array of strings

   y = deblank(c)

in which case each string in the cell array is deblanked.
