DEC2BIN Convert Decimal to Binary String

Usage

Converts an integer to a binary string.  The syntax for its
use is

   y = dec2bin(x,n)

where x is the positive integer, and n is the number of
bits to use in the representation.  Alternately, if you leave
n unspecified, 

   y = dec2bin(x)

the minimum number of bits needed to represent x are used.
If x is a vector, then the resulting y is a character
matrix.
