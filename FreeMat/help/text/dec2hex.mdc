DEC2HEX Convert Decimal Number to Hexadecimal

Usage

Converts an integer value into its hexadecimal representation.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = dec2hex(x)

where x is an integer (and is promoted to a 64-bit integer if it is not).
The returned value y is a string containing the hexadecimal representation
of that integer.  If you require a minimum length for the hexadecimal
representation, you can specify an optional second argument

   y = dec2hex(x,n)

where n indicates the minimum number of digits in the representation.
