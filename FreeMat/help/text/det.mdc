DET Determinant of a Matrix

Usage

Calculates the determinant of a matrix.  Note that for all but
very small problems, the determinant is not particularly useful.
The condition number cond gives a more reasonable estimate as
to the suitability of a matrix for inversion than comparing det(A)
to zero.  In any case, the syntax for its use is

  y = det(A)

where A is a square matrix.
