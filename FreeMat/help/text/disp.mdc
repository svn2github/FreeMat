DISP DISP Display a Variable or Expression

Usage

Displays the result of a set of expressions.  The disp function
takes a variable number of arguments, each of which is an expression
to output:

  disp(expr1,expr2,...,exprn)

This is functionally equivalent to evaluating each of the expressions
without a semicolon after each.
