DOT Dot Product Function

Usage

Computes the scalar dot product of its two arguments.  The general
syntax for its use is

  y = dot(x,z)

where x and z are numerical vectors of the same length.  If 
x and z are multi-dimensional arrays of the same size, then
the dot product is taken along the first non-singleton dimension.
You can also specify the dimension to take the dot product along using
the alternate form

  y = dot(x,z,dim)

where dim specifies the dimension to take the dot product along.
