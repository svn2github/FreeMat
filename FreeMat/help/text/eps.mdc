EPS Double Precision Floating Point Relative Machine Precision Epsilon

Usage

Returns eps, which quantifies the relative machine precision
of floating point numbers (a machine specific quantity).  The syntax
for eps is:

   y = eps
   y = eps('double')
   y = eps(X)

First form returns eps for double precision values. For most
typical processors, this value is approximately 2^-52, or 2.2204e-16.
Second form return eps for class double or single.
Third form returns distance to the next value greater than X.
