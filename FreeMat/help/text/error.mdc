ERROR ERROR Causes an Error Condition Raised

Usage

The error function causes an error condition (exception
to be raised).  The general syntax for its use is

   error(s),

where s is the string message describing the error.  The
error function is usually used in conjunction with try
and catch to provide error handling.  If the string s,
then (to conform to the MATLAB API), error does nothing.
