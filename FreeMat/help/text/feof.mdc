FEOF FEOF End Of File Function

Usage

Check to see if we are at the end of the file.  The usage is

  b = feof(handle)

The handle argument must be a valid and active file handle.  The
return is true (logical 1) if the current position is at the end of
the file, and false (logical 0) otherwise.  Note that simply reading
to the end of a file will not cause feof to return true.  
You must read past the end of the file (which will cause an error 
anyway).  See the example for more details.
