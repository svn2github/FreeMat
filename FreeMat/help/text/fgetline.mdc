FGETLINE FGETLINE Read a String from a File

Usage

Reads a string from a file.  The general syntax for its use
is

  s = fgetline(handle)

This function reads characters from the file handle into
a string array s until it encounters the end of the file
or a newline.  The newline, if any, is retained in the output
string.  If the file is at its end, (i.e., that feof would
return true on this handle), fgetline returns an empty
string.
