FIX Round Towards Zero

Usage

Rounds the argument array towards zero.  The syntax for its use is

   y = fix(x)

where x is a numeric array.  For positive elements of x, the output
is the largest integer smaller than x.  For negative elements of x
the output is the smallest integer larger than x.  For complex x,
the operation is applied seperately to the real and imaginary parts.
