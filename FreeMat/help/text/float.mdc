FLOAT Convert to 32-bit Floating Point

Usage

Converts the argument to a 32-bit floating point number.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = float(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  
Conversion follows the saturation rules.  Note that both 
NaN and Inf are both preserved under type conversion.
