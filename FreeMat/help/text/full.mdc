FULL FULL Convert Sparse Matrix to Full Matrix

Usage

Converts a sparse matrix to a full matrix.  The syntax for
its use is

   y = full(x)

The type of x is preserved.  Be careful with the function.
As a general rule of thumb, if you can work with the full
representation of a function, you probably do not need the
sparse representation.
