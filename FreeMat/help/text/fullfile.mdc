FULLFILE FULLFILE Build a Full Filename From Pieces

Usage

The fullfile routine constructs a full filename from a set of
pieces, namely, directory names and a filename.  The syntax is:

  x = fullfile(dir1,dir2,...,dirn,filename)

where each of the arguments are strings.  The fullfile function
is equivalent to [dir1 dirsep dir2 dirsep ... dirn dirsep filename].
