GETLINE Get a Line of Input from User

Usage

Reads a line (as a string) from the user.  This function has
two syntaxes.  The first is 

  a = getline(prompt)

where prompt is a prompt supplied to the user for the query.
The second syntax omits the prompt argument:

  a = getline

Note that this function requires command line input, i.e., it 
will only operate correctly for programs or scripts written
to run inside the FreeMat GUI environment or from the X11 terminal.
If you build a stand-alone application and expect it to operate 
cross-platform, do not use this function (unless you include
the FreeMat console in the final application).
