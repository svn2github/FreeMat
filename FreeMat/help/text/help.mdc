HELP HELP Help

Usage

Displays help on a function available in FreeMat.  The help function
takes one argument:

  help topic

where topic is the topic to look for help on.  For scripts, the 
result of running help is the contents of the comments at the top
of the file.  If FreeMat finds no comments, then it simply displays
the function declaration.
