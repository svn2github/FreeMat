HERMITIAN HERMITIAN Matrix Hermitian (Conjugate Transpose) Operator

Usage

Computes the Hermitian of the argument (a 2D matrix).  The syntax for its use is

  y = a';

where a is a M x N numerical matrix.  The output y is a numerical matrix
of the same type of size N x M.  This operator is the conjugating transpose,
which is different from the transpose operator .' (which does not 
conjugate complex values).
