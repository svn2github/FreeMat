general syntax for its use is

   hold(state)

where state is either

   hold('on')

to turn hold on, or

   hold('off')

to turn hold off. If you specify no argument then
hold toggles the state of the hold:

   hold

You can also specify a particular axis to the hold command

   hold(handle,...)

where handle is the handle for a particular axis.
