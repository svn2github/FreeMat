HORZCAT Overloaded Horizontal Concatenation

Usage

This is a method for a class that is invoked to concatenate two or more
variables of the same class type together.  Besides being called
when you invoke

   c = horzcat(a,b,c)

when a is a class, it is also called for 

   c = [a,b,c]

when one of these variables is a class.  The exact meaning of
horizontal concatenation depends on the class you have designed.
