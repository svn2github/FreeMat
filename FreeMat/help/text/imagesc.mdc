IMAGESC Image Display Function

Usage

The imagesc command has the following general syntax

  handle = imagesc(x,y,C,clim)

where x is a two vector containing the x coordinates
of the first and last pixels along a column, and y is a
two vector containing the y coordinates of the first and
last pixels along a row.  The matrix C constitutes the
image data.  It must either be a scalar matrix, in which case
the image is colormapped using the  colormap for the current
figure.  If the matrix is M x N x 3, then C is intepreted
as RGB data, and the image is not colormapped.  The clim
argument is a pairs [low high] that specifies scaling.  You can 
also omit the x and y, 

  handle = imagesc(C, clim)

in which case they default to x = [1,size(C,2)] and 
y = [1,size(C,1)].  Finally, you can use the image function
with only formal arguments

  handle = imagesc(properties...)
