IMREAD Read Image File To Matrix

Usage

Reads the image data from the given file into a matrix.  Note that
FreeMat's support for imread is not complete.  Only some of the
formats specified in the MATLAB API are implemented.  The syntax
for its use is

  [A,map,alpha] = imread(filename)

where filename is the name of the file to read from.  The returned
arrays A contain the image data, map contains the colormap information
(for indexed images), and alpha contains the alphamap (transparency).
The returned values will depend on the type of the original image.  Generally
you can read images in the jpg,png,xpm,ppm and some other formats.
