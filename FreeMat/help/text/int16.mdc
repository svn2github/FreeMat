INT16 Convert to Signed 16-bit Integer

Usage

Converts the argument to an signed 16-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = int16(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows the saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the normal
range for a signed 16-bit integer of [-32767,32767], it is truncated
to that range).  Note that both NaN and Inf both map to 0.
