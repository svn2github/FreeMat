INT2BIN Convert Integer Arrays to Binary

Usage

Computes the binary decomposition of an integer array to the specified
number of bits.  The general syntax for its use is

   y = int2bin(x,n)

where x is a multi-dimensional integer array, and n is the number
of bits to expand it to.  The output array y has one extra dimension
to it than the input.  The bits are expanded along this extra dimension.
