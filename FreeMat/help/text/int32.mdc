INT32 INT32 Convert to Signed 32-bit Integer

Usage

Converts the argument to an signed 32-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = int32(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows the saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the normal
range for a signed 32-bit integer of [-2147483647,2147483647], 
it is truncated to that range).  Note that both NaN and Inf both map to 0.
