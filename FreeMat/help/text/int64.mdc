INT64 INT64 Convert to Signed 64-bit Integer

Usage

Converts the argument to an signed 64-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = int64(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows the saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the normal
range for a signed 64-bit integer of [-2^63+1,2^63-1], it is
truncated to that range).  Note that both NaN and Inf both map to 0.
