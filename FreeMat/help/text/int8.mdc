INT8 INT8 Convert to Signed 8-bit Integer

Usage

Converts the argument to an signed 8-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = int8(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows the saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the normal
range for a signed 8-bit integer of [-127,127], it is truncated to that
range.  Note that
both NaN and Inf both map to 0.
