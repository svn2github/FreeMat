IPERMUTE Array Inverse Permutation Function

Usage

The ipermute function rearranges the contents of an array according
to the inverse of the specified permutation vector.  The syntax for 
its use is

   y = ipermute(x,p)

where p is a permutation vector - i.e., a vector containing the 
integers 1...ndims(x) each occuring exactly once.  The resulting
array y contains the same data as the array x, but ordered
according to the inverse of the given permutation.  This function and
the permute function are inverses of each other.
