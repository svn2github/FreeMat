ISEQUAL ISEQUAL Test For Matrix Equality

Usage

Test two arrays for equality.  The general format
for its use is

   y = isequal(a,b)

This function returns true if the two arrays are
equal (compared element-wise).  Unlike issame
the isequal function will type convert where
possible to do the comparison.
