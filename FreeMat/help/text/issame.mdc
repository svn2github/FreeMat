ISSAME Test If Two Arrays Are Identical

Usage

Tests for two arrays to be identical.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = issame(a,b)

where a and b are two arrays to compare.  This
comparison succeeds only if a and b are of the
same data type, size, and contents.  Unlike numerical
equivalence tests, the issame function considers
NaN to be equal in both arguments.
