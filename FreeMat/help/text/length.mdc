LENGTH LENGTH Length of an Array

Usage

Returns the length of an array x.  The syntax for its use
is 

   y = length(x)

and is defined as the maximum length of x along any of its
dimensions, i.e., max(size(x)).  If you want to determine the
number of elements in x, use the numel function instead.
