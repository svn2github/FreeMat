LOAD Load Variables From A File

Usage

Loads a set of variables from a file in a machine independent format.
The load function takes one argument:

  load filename,

or alternately,

  load('filename')

This command is the companion to save.  It loads the contents of the
file generated by save back into the current context.  Global and 
persistent variables are also loaded and flagged appropriately.  By
default, FreeMat assumes that files that end in a .mat or .MAT
extension are MATLAB-formatted files.  Also, FreeMat assumes that 
files that end in .txt or .TXT are ASCII files. 
For other filenames, FreeMat first tries to open the file as a 
FreeMat binary format file (as created by the save function).  
If the file fails to open as a FreeMat binary file, then FreeMat 
attempts to read it as an ASCII file.  

You can force FreeMat to assume a particular format for the file
by using alternate forms of the load command.  In particular,

  load -ascii filename

will load the data in file filename as an ASCII file (space delimited
numeric text) loaded into a single variable in the current workspace
with the name filename (without the extension).

For MATLAB-formatted data files, you can use

  load -mat filename

which forces FreeMat to assume that filename is a MAT-file, regardless
of the extension on the filename.

You can also specify which variables to load from a file (not from 
an ASCII file - only single 2-D variables can be successfully saved and
retrieved from ASCII files) using the additional syntaxes of the load
command.  In particular, you can specify a set of variables to load by name

  load filename Var_1 Var_2 Var_3 ...

where Var_n is the name of a variable to load from the file.  
Alternately, you can use the regular expression syntax

  load filename -regexp expr_1 expr_2 expr_3 ...

where expr_n is a regular expression (roughly as expected by regexp).
Note that a simpler regular expression mechanism is used for this syntax
than the full mechanism used by the regexp command.

Finally, you can use load to create a variable containing the 
contents of the file, instead of automatically inserting the variables
into the curent workspace.  For this form of load you must use the
function syntax, and capture the output:

  V = load('arg1','arg2',...)

which returns a structure V with one field for each variable
retrieved from the file.  For ASCII files, V is a double precision
matrix.
