LOG LOG Natural Logarithm Function

Usage

Computes the log function for its argument.  The general
syntax for its use is

  y = log(x)

where x is an n-dimensional array of numerical type.
Integer types are promoted to the double type prior to
calculation of the log function.  Output y is of the
same size as the input x. For strictly positive, real inputs, 
the output type is the same as the input.
For negative and complex arguments, the output is complex.
