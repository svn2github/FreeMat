LOGSPACE LOGSPACE Logarithmically Spaced Vector

Usage

Generates a row vector with the specified number number of elements,
with entries logarithmically spaced between two specified endpoints.
The syntax for its use is either

    y = logspace(a,b,count)

 or, for a default count = 50,

    y = logspace(a,b)

 A third special use is when

    y = logspace(a,pi)

where it generates points between 10^a and pi
