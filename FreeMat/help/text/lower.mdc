LOWER Convert strings to lower case

Usage

The lower function converts a string to lower case with
the syntax

   y = lower(x)

where x is a string, in which case all of the upper case
characters in x (defined as the range 'A'-'Z') are
converted to lower case.  Alternately, you can call lower
with a cell array of strings

   y = lower(c)

in which case each string in the cell array is converted to lower case.
