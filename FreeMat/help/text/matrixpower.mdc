MATRIXPOWER Matrix Power Operator

Usage

The power operator for scalars and square matrices.  This operator is really a 
combination of two operators, both of which have the same general syntax:

  y = a ^ b

The exact action taken by this operator, and the size and type of the output, 
depends on which of the two configurations of a and b is present:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a is a scalar, b is a square matrix
  \item a is a square matrix, b is a scalar
\end{enumerate}
