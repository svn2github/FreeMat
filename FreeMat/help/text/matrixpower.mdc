MATRIXPOWER MATRIXPOWER Matrix Power Operator

Usage

The power operator for scalars and square matrices.  This operator is really a 
combination of two operators, both of which have the same general syntax:

  y = a ^ b

The exact action taken by this operator, and the size and type of the output, 
depends on which of the two configurations of a and b is present:
  1.  a is a scalar, b is a square matrix

  2.  a is a square matrix, b is a scalar
