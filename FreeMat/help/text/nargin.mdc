NARGIN NARGIN Number of Input Arguments

Usage

The nargin function returns the number of arguments passed
to a function when it was called.  The general syntax for its
use is

  y = nargin

FreeMat allows for
fewer arguments to be passed to a function than were declared,
and nargin, along with isset can be used to determine
exactly what subset of the arguments were defined.
