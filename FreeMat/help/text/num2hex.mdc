Usage

Converts single and double precision arrays to IEEE hex strings.  The
syntax for its use is

   y = num2hex(x)

where x is either a float or double array.  The output y is
a n-by-p character array, where n is the number of elements in x,
and p is 16 for double arrays, and 8 for single arrays.
