PATCH PATCH Patch Graphics Function

Usage

This routine is used to create a patch object that can be plotting 2D and 3D surfaces.  A 
patch is a polygon defined by the xyz coordinates
of its vertices and optionally by the color at the vertices.
There are several forms for the patch function:

  h = patch(X,Y,C,properties...)
  h = patch(X,Y,Z,C,properties...)
  h = patch(properties...)
  h = patch(V)

Where X, Y and Z are matrices or vectors of x, y or z coordinates
and C is a matrix or vector of color values (the colormap
for the current fig is applied).
