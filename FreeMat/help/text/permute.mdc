PERMUTE PERMUTE Array Permutation Function

Usage

The permute function rearranges the contents of an array according
to the specified permutation vector.  The syntax for its use is

    y = permute(x,p)

where p is a permutation vector - i.e., a vector containing the 
integers 1...ndims(x) each occuring exactly once.  The resulting
array y contains the same data as the array x, but ordered
according to the permutation.  This function is a generalization of
the matrix transpose operation.
