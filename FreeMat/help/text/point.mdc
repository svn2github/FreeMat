POINT Get Axis Position From Mouse Click

Usage

Returns information about the currently displayed image based on a use
supplied mouse-click.  The general syntax for its use is

   t = point

The returned vector y has two elements: 
where x,y are the coordinates in the current axes of the click.  This 
function has changed since FreeMat 1.10.  If the click is not inside the
active area of any set of axes, a pair of NaNs are returned.
