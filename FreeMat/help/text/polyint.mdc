POLYINT POLYINT Polynomial Coefficient Integration

Usage

 The polyint function returns the polynomial coefficients resulting
 from integration of polynomial p. The syntax for its use is either

 pint = polyint(p,k)

 or, for a default k = 0,

 pint = polyint(p);

 where p is a vector of polynomial coefficients assumed to be in
 decreasing degree and k is the integration constant.
