POLYVAL Evaluate Polynomial Fit at Selected Points

Usage

The polyval routine has the following syntax

  y = polyval(p,x)

where p is a vector of polynomial coefficients,
in decreasing degree (as generated by polyfit, for example).
If x is a matrix, the polynomial is evaluated in the matrix
sense (in which case x must be square).
