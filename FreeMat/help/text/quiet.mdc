is when executing code.  The syntax for the function is

   quiet flag

where flag is one of
  -  'normal' - normal output from the interpreter

  -  'quiet' - only intentional output (e.g. printf calls and
disp calls) is printed.  The output of expressions that are not
terminated in semicolons are not printed.
