RAND Uniform Random Number Generator

Usage

Creates an array of pseudo-random numbers of the specified size.
The numbers are uniformly distributed on [0,1).  
Two seperate syntaxes are possible.  The first syntax specifies the array 
dimensions as a sequence of scalar dimensions:

  y = rand(d1,d2,...,dn).

The resulting array has the given dimensions, and is filled with
random numbers.  The type of y is double, a 64-bit floating
point array.  To get arrays of other types, use the typecast 
functions.
    
The second syntax specifies the array dimensions as a vector,
where each element in the vector specifies a dimension length:

  y = rand([d1,d2,...,dn]).

This syntax is more convenient for calling rand using a 
variable for the argument.

Finally, rand supports two additional forms that allow
you to manipulate the state of the random number generator.
The first retrieves the state

  y = rand('state')

which is a 625 length integer vector.  The second form sets
the state

  rand('state',y)

or alternately, you can reset the random number generator with

  rand('state',0)
