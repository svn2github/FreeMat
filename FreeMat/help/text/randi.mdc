RANDI Uniformly Distributed Integer

Usage

Generates an array of uniformly distributed integers between
the two supplied limits.  The general syntax for randi is

   y = randi(low,high)

where low and high are arrays of integers.  Scalars
can be used for one of the arguments.  The output y is
a uniformly distributed pseudo-random number between low
and high (inclusive).
