RANDMULTI Generate Multinomial-distributed Random Variables

Usage

This function generates samples from a multinomial distribution
given the probability of each outcome.  The general syntax for
its use is

   y = randmulti(N,pvec)

where N is the number of experiments to perform, and pvec
is the vector of probabilities describing the distribution of
outcomes.
