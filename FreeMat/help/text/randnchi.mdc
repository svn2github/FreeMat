RANDNCHI RANDNCHI Generate Noncentral Chi-Square Random Variable

Usage

Generates a vector of non-central chi-square random variables
with the given number of degrees of freedom and the given
non-centrality parameters.  The general syntax for its use is

   y = randnchi(n,mu)

where n is an array containing the degrees of freedom for
each generated random variable (with each element of n >= 1),
and mu is the non-centrality shift (must be positive).
