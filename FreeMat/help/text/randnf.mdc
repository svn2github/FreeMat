RANDNF RANDNF Generate Noncentral F-Distribution Random Variable

Usage

Generates a vector of non-central F-distributed random variables
with the specified parameters.  The general syntax for its use is

   y = randnf(n,m,c)

where n is the number of degrees of freedom in the numerator,
and m is the number of degrees of freedom in the denominator.
The vector c determines the non-centrality shift of the numerator.
