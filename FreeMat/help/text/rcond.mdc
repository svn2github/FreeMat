RCOND RCOND Reciprocal Condition Number Estimate

Usage

The rcond function is a FreeMat wrapper around LAPACKs
function XGECON, which estimates the 1-norm condition
number (reciprocal).  For the details of the algorithm see
the LAPACK documentation.  The syntax for its use is

   x = rcond(A)

where A is a matrix.
