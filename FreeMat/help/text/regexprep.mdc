REGEXPREP Regular Expression Replacement Function

Usage

Replaces regular expressions in the provided string.  The syntax for its
use is 

  outstring = regexprep(instring,pattern,replacement,modes)

Here instring is the string to be operated on.  And pattern is a regular
expression of the type accepted by regexp.  For each match, the contents
of the matched string are replaced with the replacement text.  Tokens in the
regular expression can be used in the replacement text using $N where N
is the number of the token to use.  You can also specify the same mode 
flags that are used by regexp.
