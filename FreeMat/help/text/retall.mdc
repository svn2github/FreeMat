RETALL Return From All Keyboard Sessions

Usage

The retall statement is used to return to the base workspace
from a nested keyboard session.  It is equivalent to forcing
execution to return to the main prompt, regardless of the level
of nesting of keyboard sessions, or which functions are
running.  The syntax is simple

   retall

The retall is a convenient way to stop debugging.  In the
process of debugging a complex program or set of functions,
you may find yourself 5 function calls down into the program
only to discover the problem.  After fixing it, issueing
a retall effectively forces FreeMat to exit your program
and return to the interactive prompt.
