RETURN Return From Function

Usage

The return statement is used to immediately return from
a function, or to return from a keyboard session.  The 
syntax for its use is

  return

Inside a function, a return statement causes FreeMat
to exit the function immediately.  When a keyboard session
is active, the return statement causes execution to
resume where the keyboard session started.
