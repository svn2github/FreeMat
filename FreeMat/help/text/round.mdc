ROUND ROUND Round Function

Usage

Rounds an n-dimensional array to the nearest integer elementwise.
The general syntax for its use is

   y = round(x)

where x is a multidimensional array of numerical type.  The round 
function preserves the type of the argument.  So integer arguments 
are not modified, and float arrays return float arrays as 
outputs, and similarly for double arrays.  The round function 
is not defined for complex or dcomplex types.
