RREF Reduced Row Echelon Form of a Matrix

Usage

Calculates the reduced row echelon form of a matrix using Gauss
Jordan elimination with partial pivoting.  The generic syntax
for rref is 

   R = rref(A)

A default tolerance of max(size(A))*eps*norm(A,inf) is used to
detect negligible column elements.  The second form of rref 
returns a vector k as well as R

  [R,k] = rref(A)

where k is a vector that correponds to the columns of A 
used as pivot columns.  If you want to control the tolerance
used to identify negligible elements, you can use the form

  [R,k] = rref(A, tolerance)

This implementation of rref is based on the one from 
the matcompat lib for octave.  It is copyright Paul Kienzle,
