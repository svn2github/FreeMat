SEC Trigonometric Secant Function

Usage

Computes the sec function for its argument.  The general
syntax for its use is

  y = sec(x)

where x is an n-dimensional array of numerical type.
Integer types are promoted to the double type prior to
calculation of the sec function.  Output y is of the
same size and type as the input x, (unless x is an
integer, in which case y is a double type).
