SEED Seed the Random Number Generator

Usage

Seeds the random number generator using the given integer seeds.  
Changing the seed allows you to choose which pseudo-random
sequence is generated.  The seed takes two uint32 values:

  seed(s,t)

where s and t are the seed values.  Note that due to limitations
in ranlib, the values of s,t must be between 0 <= s,t <= 2^30.
