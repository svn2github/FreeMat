SETPATH SETPATH Set Current Search Path

Usage

Changes the current FreeMat search path.  The general syntax for
its use is

  setpath(y)

where y is a string containing a delimited list of directories
to be searched for M files and libraries.  
The delimiter between the paths depends on the system being used.  For Win32, the
delimiter is a semicolon.  For all other systems, the delimiter is a colon.

@Example
The setpath function is straightforward.

--> getpath

ans = 
  Empty array 1 0
--> setpath('/usr/local/FreeMat/MFiles:/localhome/basu/MFiles')
--> getpath

ans = 
/usr/local/FreeMat/MFiles:/localhome/basu/MFiles
