SIZE SIZE Size of a Variable

Usage

Returns the size of a variable.  There are two syntaxes for its
use.  The first syntax returns the size of the array as a vector
of integers, one integer for each dimension

  [d1,d2,...,dn] = size(x)

The other format returns the size of x along a particular
dimension:

  d = size(x,n)

where n is the dimension along which to return the size.
