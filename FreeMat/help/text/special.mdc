SPECIAL Special Calling Syntax

Usage

To reduce the effort to call certain functions, FreeMat supports
a special calling syntax for functions that take string arguments.
In particular, the three following syntaxes are equivalent, with
one caveat:

   functionname('arg1','arg2',...,'argn')

or the parenthesis and commas can be removed

   functionname 'arg1' 'arg2' ... 'argn'

The quotes are also optional (providing, of course, that the
argument strings have no spaces in them)

   functionname arg1 arg2 ... argn

This special syntax enables you to type hold on instead of
the more cumbersome hold('on').  The caveat is that FreeMat
currently only recognizes the special calling syntax as the
first statement on a line of input.  Thus, the following construction

  for i=1:10; plot(vec(i)); hold on; end

would not work.  This limitation may be removed in a future
version.
