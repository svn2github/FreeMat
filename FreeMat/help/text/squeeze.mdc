SQUEEZE Remove Singleton Dimensions of an Array

Usage

This function removes the singleton dimensions of an array.  The
syntax for its use is

   y = squeeze(x)

where x is a multidimensional array.  Generally speaking, if
x is of size d1 x 1 x d2 x ..., then squeeze(x) is of
size d1 x d2 x ..., i.e., each dimension of x that was
singular (size 1) is squeezed out.
