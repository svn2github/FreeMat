SSCANF Formated String Input Function (C-Style)

Usage

Reads values from a string.  The general syntax for its use is

  [a, count, errmsg, nextind] = sscanf(text,format,[size])

Here format is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the input, size specifies the amount of data to be read. Values that are parsed
from the text are stored in a. Note that sscanf is vectorized - the format string is reused as long as
there are entries in the text string. See printf
for a description of the format.
