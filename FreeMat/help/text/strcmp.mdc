STRCMP String Compare Function

Usage

Compares two strings for equality.  The general
syntax for its use is

  p = strcmp(x,y)

where x and y are two strings.  Returns true if x
and y are the same size, and are equal (as strings).  Otherwise,
it returns false.
In the second form, strcmp can be applied to a cell array of
strings.  The syntax for this form is

  p = strcmp(cellstra,cellstrb)

where cellstra and cellstrb are cell arrays of a strings
to compare.  Also, you can also supply a character matrix as
an argument to strcmp, in which case it will be converted
via cellstr (so that trailing spaces are removed), before being
compared.
