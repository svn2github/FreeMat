STRFIND Find Substring in a String

Usage

Searches through a string for a pattern, and returns the starting
positions of the pattern in an array.  There are two forms for 
the strfind function.  The first is for single strings

   ndx = strfind(string, pattern)

the resulting array ndx contains the starting indices in string
for the pattern pattern.  The second form takes a cell array of 
strings

   ndx = strfind(cells, pattern)

and applies the search operation to each string in the cell array.
