STRSTR String Search Function

Usage

Searches for the first occurance of one string inside another.
The general syntax for its use is

   p = strstr(x,y)

where x and y are two strings.  The returned integer p
indicates the index into the string x where the substring y
occurs.  If no instance of y is found, then p is set to
zero.
