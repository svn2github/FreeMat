STRTRIM Trim Spaces from a String

Usage

Removes the white-spaces at the beginning and end of a string (or a 
cell array of strings). See isspace for a definition of a white-space.
There are two forms for the strtrim function.  The first is for
single strings

   y = strtrim(strng)

where strng is a string.  The second form operates on a cell array
of strings

   y = strtrim(cellstr)

and trims each string in the cell array.
