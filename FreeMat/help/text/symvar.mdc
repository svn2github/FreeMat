SYMVAR SYMVAR Find Symbolic Variables in an Expression

Usage

Finds the symbolic variables in an expression.  The syntax for its
use is 

  syms = symvar(expr)

where expr is a string containing an expression, such as
'x^2 + cos(t+alpha)'.  The result is a cell array of strings
containing the non-function identifiers in the expression.  Because
they are usually not used as identifiers in expressions, the strings
 'pi','inf','nan','eps','i','j' are ignored.
