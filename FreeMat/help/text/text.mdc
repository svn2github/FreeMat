TEXT Add Text Label to Plot

Usage

Adds a text label to the currently active plot.  The general
syntax for it is use is either

   text(x,y,'label')

where x and y are both vectors of the same length, in which
case the text 'label' is added to the current plot at each of the
coordinates x(i),y(i) (using the current axis to map these to screen
coordinates).  The second form supplies a cell-array of strings
as the second argument, and allows you to place many labels simultaneously

   text(x,y,{'label1','label2',....})

where the number of elements in the cell array must match the size of
vectors x and y.  You can also specify properties for the labels
via

   handles = text(x,y,{labels},properties...)
