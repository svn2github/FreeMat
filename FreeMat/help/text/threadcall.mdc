Usage

The threadcall function is a convenience function for executing
a function call in a thread.  The syntax for its use is

   [val1,...,valn] = threadcall(threadid,timeout,funcname,arg1,arg2,...)

where threadid is the ID of the thread (as returned by the
threadnew function), funcname is the name of the function to call,
and argi are the arguments to the function, and timeout is the
amount of time (in milliseconds) that the function is allowed to take.
