THREADID Get Current Thread Handle

Usage

The threadid function in FreeMat tells you which thread
is executing the context you are in.  Normally, this is thread
1, the main thread.  However, if you start a new thread using
threadnew, you will be operating in a new thread, and functions
that call threadid from the new thread will return their 
handles.
