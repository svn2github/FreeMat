THREADKILL Halt execution of a thread

Usage

The threadkill function stops (or attempts to stop) execution
of the given thread.  It works only for functions defined in M-files
(i.e., not for built in or imported functions), and it works by 
setting a flag that causes the thread to stop execution at the next
available statement.  The syntax for this function is 

  threadkill(handle)

where handle is the value returned by a threadnew call.  
Note that the threadkill function returns immediately.  It 
is still your responsibility to call threadfree to free
the thread you have halted.

You cannot kill the main thread (thread id 1).
