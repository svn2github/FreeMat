UINT16 UINT16 Convert to Unsigned 16-bit Integer

Usage

Converts the argument to an unsigned 16-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = uint16(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the normal
range for an unsigned 16-bit integer of [0,65535], it is truncated
to that range.  Note that
both NaN and Inf both map to 0.
