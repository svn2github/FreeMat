UINT32 Convert to Unsigned 32-bit Integer

Usage

Converts the argument to an unsigned 32-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = uint32(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the normal
range for an unsigned 32-bit integer of [0,4294967295], it is
truncated to that range. Note that both NaN and Inf both map to 0.
