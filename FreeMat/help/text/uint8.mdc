UINT8 UINT8 Convert to Unsigned 8-bit Integer

Usage

Converts the argument to an unsigned 8-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is

   y = uint8(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the normal
range for an unsigned 8-bit integer of [0,255], it is truncated 
to that range. Note that
both NaN and Inf both map to 0.
