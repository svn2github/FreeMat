UPPER UPPER Convert strings to upper case

Usage

The upper function converts a string to upper case with
the syntax

   y = upper(x)

where x is a string, in which case all of the lower case
characters in x (defined as the range 'a'-'z') are
converted to upper case.  Alternately, you can call upper
with a cell array of strings

   y = upper(c)

in which case each string in the cell array is converted to upper case.
