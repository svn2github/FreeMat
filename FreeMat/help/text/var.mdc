VAR VAR Variance Function

Usage

Computes the variance of an array along a given dimension.  The general
syntax for its use is

  y = var(x,d)

where x is an n-dimensions array of numerical type.
The output is of the same numerical type as the input.  The argument
d is optional, and denotes the dimension along which to take
the variance.  The output y is the same size as x, except
that it is singular along the mean direction.  So, for example,
if x is a 3 x 3 x 4 array, and we compute the mean along
dimension d=2, then the output is of size 3 x 1 x 4.
