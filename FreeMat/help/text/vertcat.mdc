VERTCAT Overloaded Vertical Concatenation

Usage

This is a method for a class that is invoked to concatenate two or more
variables of the same class type together.  Besides being called when
you invoke

   c = vertcat(a,b,c)

when a is a class, it is also called for

   c = [a;b;c]

when one of the variables is a class.  The exact meaning of 
vertical concatenation depends on the class you have designed.
