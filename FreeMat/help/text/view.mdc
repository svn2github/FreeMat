VIEW Set Graphical View

Usage

The view function sets the view into the current plot.
The simplest form is

  view(n)

where n=2 sets a standard view (azimuth 0 and elevation 90),
and n=3 sets a standard 3D view (azimuth 37.5 and elevation 30).
With two arguments,

  view(az,el)

you set the viewpoint to azimuth az and elevation el.
