WHILE While Loop

Usage

The while loop executes a set of statements as long as
a the test condition remains true.  The syntax of a
while loop is

  while test_expression
     statements
  end

Note that a conditional expression is considered true if
the real part of the result of the expression contains
any non-zero elements (this strange convention is adopted
for compatibility with MATLAB).
