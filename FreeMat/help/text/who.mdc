WHO Describe Currently Defined Variables

Usage

Reports information on either all variables in the current context
or on a specified set of variables.  For each variable, the who
function indicates the size and type of the variable as well as 
if it is a global or persistent.  There are two formats for the 
function call.  The first is the explicit form, in which a list
of variables are provided:

  who a1 a2 ...

In the second form

  who

the who function lists all variables defined in the current 
context (as well as global and persistent variables). Note that
there are two alternate forms for calling the who function:

  who 'a1' 'a2' ...

and

  who('a1','a2',...)
