ZEROS Array of Zeros

Usage

Creates an array of zeros of the specified size.  Two seperate 
syntaxes are possible.  The first syntax specifies the array 
dimensions as a sequence of scalar dimensions:

   y = zeros(d1,d2,...,dn).

The resulting array has the given dimensions, and is filled with
all zeros.  The type of y is double, a 64-bit floating
point array.  To get arrays of other types, use the typecast 
functions (e.g., uint8, int8, etc.).  An alternative syntax
is to use the following notation:

   y = zeros(d1,d2,...,dn,classname)

where classname is one of 'double', 'single', 'int8', 'uint8',
'int16', 'uint16', 'int32', 'uint32', 'int64', 'uint64', 'float', 'logical'.  
    
The second syntax specifies the array dimensions as a vector,
where each element in the vector specifies a dimension length:

   y = zeros([d1,d2,...,dn]),

or

   y = zeros([d1,d2,...,dn],classname).

This syntax is more convenient for calling zeros using a 
variable for the argument.  In both cases, specifying only one
dimension results in a square matrix output.
