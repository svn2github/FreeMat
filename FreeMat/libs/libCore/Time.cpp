//@|toc| to get the elapsed time.  The usage is
//@[
//  tic
//@]
//@@Example
//Here is an example of timing the solution of a large matrix equation.
//@<
//A = rand(100);
//b = rand(100,1);

//@Module CLOCK Get Current Time

//@@Usage
//Returns the current date and time as a vector.  The syntax for its use is
//@[
//   y = clock
//@]
//where @|y| has the following format:
//@[
//   y = [year month day hour minute seconds]

//@@Example
//Here is the time that this manual was last built:

//@Module CLOCKTOTIME Convert Clock Vector to Epoch Time
//@@Section FreeMat
//@@Usage
//Given the output of the @|clock| command, this function computes
//the epoch time, i.e, the time in seconds since January 1,1970 
//at 00:00:00 UTC.  This function is most useful for calculating elapsed
//times using the clock, and should be accurate to less than a millisecond
//(although the true accuracy depends on accuracy of the argument vector). 
//The usage for @|clocktotime| is
//@[
//   y = clocktotime(x)
//@]
//where @|x| must be in the form of the output of @|clock|, that is
//@[
//   x = [year month day hour minute seconds]
//@]
//@@Example
//Here is an example of using @|clocktotime| to time a delay of 1 second
//@<
//x = clock
//sleep(1)
//y = clock
//clocktotime(y) - clocktotime(x)
//@>
