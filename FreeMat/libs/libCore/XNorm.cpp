//@Module XNRM2 BLAS Norm Calculation
//@@Section ARRAY
//@@Usage
//Calculates the 2-norm of a vector.  The syntax for its use
//is
//@[
//   y = xnrm2(A)
//@]
//where @|A| is the n-dimensional array to analyze.  This form
//uses the underlying BLAS implementation to compute the 2-norm.
//@@Signature
//function xnrm2 XNrm2Function jitsafe
//inputs A
//outputs y
//!
