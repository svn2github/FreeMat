\subsection{CONNECT Connect To A Server}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Connects to a server socket (running in principle on another 
machine, but definitely on another session of FreeMat) and returns a handle 
to the resulting socket.
\begin{verbatim}
  handle = connect(address,portnumber)
\end{verbatim}
The portnumber is an integer in the range $[1024-65535]$.  The
address is a string containing an ethernet address in either
numerical form (e.g., \texttt{'127.0.0.1'}), or a name (e.g., 
\texttt{'foo.bar.com'}).  The resulting \verb|handle| can then be passed
to \verb|send| and \verb|receive| to send arrays over the link.
\subsubsection{Example}
Here is an example of how an array is sent over a socket link on two sessions of FreeMat.  On session one, we execute the following:
\begin{verbatim}
--> a = server(36230)
a =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
--> b = accept(a)
\end{verbatim}
At this point the first session will suspend.  In a second session, we execute the following:
\begin{verbatim}
--> c = connect('127.0.0.1',36230)
c =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
\end{verbatim}
In the first session, we get a return from \verb|accept|:
\begin{verbatim}
--> a = server(36230)
a =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
--> b = accept(a)
b =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
\end{verbatim}
At this point a link is set up between the two sessions.  If we execute a \verb|send| in session two:
\begin{verbatim}
--> send(c,'Hello world!')
\end{verbatim}
Then a \verb|receive| in session one results in
\begin{verbatim}
--> y = receive(b)
y =
  <string>  - size: [1 12]
 Hello world!
\end{verbatim}
