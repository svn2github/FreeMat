\subsection{COT Trigonometric Cotangent Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Computes the \verb|cot| function for its argument.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  y = cot(x)
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensional array of numerical type.
Integer types are promoted to the \verb|double| type prior to
calculation of the $\cot$ function.  Output $y$ is of the
same size and type as the input $x$, (unless $x$ is an
integer, in which case $y$ is a \verb|double| type).  
\subsubsection{Function Internals}
Mathematically, the $\cot$ function is defined for all 
arguments $x$ as
\[
  \cot x \equiv \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]
For complex valued arguments $z$, the cotangent is computed via
\[
  \cot z \equiv \frac{\cos 2 \Re z + \cosh 2 \Im z}{\sin 2 \Re z + 
  i \sinh 2 \Im z}.
\]
\subsubsection{Example}
The following piece of code plots the real-valued $\cot(x)$
function over the interval $[-1,1]$:
\begin{verbatim}
--> t = linspace(-1,1);
--> plot(t,cot(t))
\end{verbatim}
\doplot{width=8cm}{cotplot}
