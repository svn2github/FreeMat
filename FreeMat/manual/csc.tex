\subsection{CSC Trigonometric Cosecant Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Computes the \verb|csc| function for its argument.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  y = csc(x)
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensional array of numerical type.
Integer types are promoted to the \verb|double| type prior to
calculation of the $\csc$ function.  Output $y$ is of the
same size and type as the input $x$, (unless $x$ is an
integer, in which case $y$ is a \verb|double| type).  
\subsubsection{Function Internals}
Mathematically, the $\csc$ function is defined for all arguments
as
\[
   \csc x \equiv \frac{1}{\sin x}.
\]
\subsubsection{Example}
The following piece of code plots the real-valued $\csc(2\pi x)$
function over the interval of $[-1,1]$:
\begin{verbatim}
--> t = linspace(-1,1,1000);
--> plot(t,csc(2*pi*t))
--> axis([-1,1,-10,10])
\end{verbatim}
\doplot{width=8cm}{cscplot}
