\subsection{DOTLEFTDIVIDE Element-wise Left-Division Operator}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Divides two numerical arrays (elementwise) - gets its name from the 
fact that the divisor is on the left.  There are two forms
for its use, both with the same general syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
  y = a .\ b
\end{verbatim}
where $a$ and $b$ are $n$-dimensional arrays of numerical type.  In the
first case, the two arguments are the same size, in which case, the 
output $y$ is the same size as the inputs, and is the element-wise
division of $b$ by $a$.  In the second case, either $a$ or $b$ is a scalar, 
in which case $y$ is the same size as the larger argument,
and is the division of the scalar with each element of the other argument.

The type of $y$ depends on the types of $a$ and $b$ using type 
promotion rules, with one important exception: unlike \verb|C|, integer
types are promoted to \verb|double| prior to division.
\subsubsection{Function Internals}
There are three formulae for the dot-left-divide operator, depending on the
sizes of the three arguments.  In the most general case, in which 
the two arguments are the same size, the output is computed via:
\[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}{a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}
\]
If $a$ is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}{a}
\]
On the other hand, if $b$ is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{b}{a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}.
\]
\subsubsection{Examples}
Here are some examples of using the dot-left-divide operator.  First, a 
straight-forward usage of the \verb|.\\| operator.  The first example
is straightforward:
\begin{verbatim}
--> 3 .\ 8
ans =
  <double>  - size: [1 1]
    2.666666666666667
\end{verbatim}
Note that this is not the same as evaluating $8/3$ in \verb|C| - there,
the output would be $2$, the result of the integer division.

We can also divide complex arguments:
\begin{verbatim}
--> a = 3 + 4*i
a =
  <complex>  - size: [1 1]
    3.0000000         4.0000000     i
--> b = 5 + 8*i
b =
  <complex>  - size: [1 1]
    5.0000000         8.0000000     i
--> c = b .\ a
c =
  <complex>  - size: [1 1]
    0.52808988       -0.044943821   i
\end{verbatim}
If a \verb|complex| value is divided by a \verb|double|, the result is 
promoted to \verb|dcomplex|.
\begin{verbatim}
--> b = a .\ 2.0
b =
  <dcomplex>  - size: [1 1]
    0.240000000000000       -0.320000000000000    i
\end{verbatim}
We can also demonstrate the three forms of the dot-left-divide operator.  First
the element-wise version:
\begin{verbatim}
--> a = [1,2;3,4]
a =
  <int32>  - size: [2 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
             1              2
             3              4
--> b = [2,3;6,7]
b =
  <int32>  - size: [2 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
             2              3
             6              7
--> c = a .\ b
c =
  <double>  - size: [2 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    2.000000000000000         1.500000000000000
    2.000000000000000         1.750000000000000
\end{verbatim}
Then the scalar versions
\begin{verbatim}
--> c = a .\ 3
c =
  <double>  - size: [2 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    3.000000000000000         1.500000000000000
    1.000000000000000         0.750000000000000
--> c = 3 .\ a
c =
  <double>  - size: [2 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    0.333333333333333         0.666666666666667
    1.000000000000000         1.333333333333333
\end{verbatim}
