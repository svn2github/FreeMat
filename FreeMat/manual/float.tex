\subsection{FLOAT Convert to 32-bit Floating Point}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Converts the argument to a 32-bit floating point number.  The syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = float(x)
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion follows the general C rules.  Note that both \verb|NaN| and \verb|Inf| are both preserved under type conversion.
\subsubsection{Example}
The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of \verb|float|.  First, we convert from an integer (the argument is an integer because no decimal is present):
\begin{verbatim}
--> float(200)
ans =
  <float>  - size: [1 1]
  200.00000
\end{verbatim}
In the next example, a double precision argument is passed in (the presence of a decimal without the \verb|f| suffix implies double precision).
\begin{verbatim}
--> float(400.0)
ans =
  <float>  - size: [1 1]
  400.00000
\end{verbatim}
In the next example, a dcomplex argument is passed in.  The result is the real part of the argument, and in this context, \verb|float| is equivalent to the function \verb|real|.
\begin{verbatim}
--> float(3.0+4.0*i)
ans =
  <float>  - size: [1 1]
    3.0000000
\end{verbatim}
In the next example, a string argument is passed in.  The string argument is converted into an integer array corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.
\begin{verbatim}
--> float('helo')
ans =
  <float>  - size: [1 4]
  
Columns 1 to 4
  104.00000          101.00000          108.00000          111.00000
\end{verbatim}
In the last example, a cell-array is passed in.  For cell-arrays and structure arrays, the result is an error.
\begin{verbatim}
--> float({4})
Error: Cannot convert cell-arrays to any other type.
\end{verbatim}
