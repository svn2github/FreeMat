\subsection{LOAD Load Variables From A File}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Loads a set of variables from a file in a machine independent format.
The load function takes one argument:
\begin{verbatim}
  load filename
\end{verbatim}
This command is the companion to \verb|save|.  It loads the contents of the
file generated by \verb|save| back into the current context.  Global and 
persistent variables are also loaded and flagged appropriately.
\subsubsection{Example}
Here is a simple example of \verb|save|/\verb|load|.  First, we save some variables to a file.
\begin{verbatim}
--> who
  Variable Name      Type   Flags   Size
              D      cell           [1 4]
              s    string           [1 5]
              x     float           [512 1]
              y     float           [1 262144]
             fp    uint32           [1 1]
            ans    double           []
--> save loadsave.dat
\end{verbatim}
Next, we clear all of the variables, and then load them back from the file.
\begin{verbatim}
--> clear all
--> who
  Variable Name      Type   Flags   Size
            ans    double           []
--> load loadsave.dat
--> who
  Variable Name      Type   Flags   Size
              D      cell           [1 4]
              s    string           [1 5]
              x     float           [512 1]
              y     float           [1 262144]
             fp    uint32           [1 1]
            ans    double           []
\end{verbatim}
