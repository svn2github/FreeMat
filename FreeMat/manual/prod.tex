\subsection{PROD Product Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Computes the product of an array along a given dimension.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = prod(x,{d})
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensions array of numerical type.
The output is of the same numerical type as the input, except 
for integer types, which are automatically promoted to \verb|int32|.
 The argument $d$ is optional, and denotes the dimension along which to take
the product.  The output is computed via
\[
  y(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},1,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}) = 
    \prod_{k} x(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},k,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p})
\]
If $d$ is omitted, then the product is taken along the 
first non-singleton dimension of $x$. 
\subsubsection{Example}
The following piece of code demonstrates various uses of the product
function
\begin{verbatim}
--> A = [5,1,3;3,2,1;0,3,1]
A =
  <int32>  - size: [3 3]
  
Columns 1 to 3
             5              1              3
             3              2              1
             0              3              1
\end{verbatim}
We start by calling \verb|prod| without a dimension argument, in which case it defaults to the first nonsingular dimension (in this case, along the columns or $d = 1$).
\begin{verbatim}
--> prod(A)
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 3]
  
Columns 1 to 3
             0              6              3
\end{verbatim}
Next, we take the product along the rows.
\begin{verbatim}
--> prod(A,2)
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [3 1]
  
Columns 1 to 1
            15
             6
             0
\end{verbatim}
