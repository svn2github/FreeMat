\subsection{REAL Real Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Returns the real part of the input array for all elements.  The 
general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = real(x)
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensional array of numerical type.  The output 
is the same numerical type as the input, unless the input is \verb|complex|
or \verb|dcomplex|.  For \verb|complex| inputs, the real part is a floating
point array, so that the return type is \verb|float|.  For \verb|dcomplex|
inputs, the real part is a double precision floating point array, so that
the return type is \verb|double|.  The \verb|real| function does
nothing to real and integer types.
\subsubsection{Example}
The following demonstrates the \verb|real| applied to a complex scalar.
\begin{verbatim}
--> real(3+4*i)
ans =
  <float>  - size: [1 1]
    3.0000000
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|real| function has no effect on real arguments:
\begin{verbatim}
--> real([2,3,4])
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 3]
  
Columns 1 to 3
             2              3              4
\end{verbatim}
For a double-precision complex array,
\begin{verbatim}
--> real([2.0+3.0*i,i])
ans =
  <double>  - size: [1 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    2.000000000000000         0.000000000000000
\end{verbatim}
