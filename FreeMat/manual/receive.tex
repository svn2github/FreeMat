\subsection{RECEIVE Receive An Array Over A Socket Link}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Receive an array across a connected socket link (returned
either by \verb|accept| of \verb|connect|).  The call syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
  x = receive(handle)
\end{verbatim}
If there is no array to be read, the call will 'block', meaning
that it will wait until an array is sent using a \verb|send| command
by the other end of the socket link.
\subsubsection{Example}
Here is an example of how an array is sent over a socket link on two sessions of FreeMat.  On session one, we execute the following:
\begin{verbatim}
--> a = server(36230)
a =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
--> b = accept(a)
\end{verbatim}
At this point the first session will suspend.  In a second session, we execute the following:
\begin{verbatim}
--> c = connect('127.0.0.1',36230)
c =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
\end{verbatim}
In the first session, we get a return from \verb|accept|:
\begin{verbatim}
--> a = server(36230)
a =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
--> b = accept(a)
b =
  <uint32>  - size: [1 1]
            1
\end{verbatim}
At this point a link is set up between the two sessions.  If we execute a \verb|send| in session two:
\begin{verbatim}
--> send(c,'Hello world!')
\end{verbatim}
Then a \verb|receive| in session one results in
\begin{verbatim}
--> y = receive(b)
y =
  <string>  - size: [1 12]
 Hello world!
\end{verbatim}
