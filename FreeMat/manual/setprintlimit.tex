\subsection{SETPRINTLIMIT Set Limit For Printing Of Arrays}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Changes the limit on how many elements of an array are printed
using either the \verb|disp| function or using expressions on the
command line without a semi-colon.  The default is set to 
one thousand elements.  You can increase or decrease this
limit by calling
\begin{verbatim}
  setprintlimit(n)
\end{verbatim}
where $n$ is the new limit to use.
\subsubsection{Example}
Setting a smaller print limit avoids pages of output when you forget the semicolon on an expression.
\begin{verbatim}
--> A = randn(512);
--> setprintlimit(10)
--> A
ans =
  <double>  - size: [512 512]
