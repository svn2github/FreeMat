\subsection{USEPLOT Use Plot Window Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Changes the active plot window to the specified handle (or plot number).  
The general syntax for its use is 
\begin{verbatim}
  useplot(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is the handle to use.  If the plot window corresponding to
\verb|x| does not already exist, a new window with this handle number is 
created.
\subsubsection{Example}
In this example, we create two plot windows, and then use the \verb|useplot|
command to activate the first window.
\begin{verbatim}
--> newplot
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 1]
             1
--> newplot
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 1]
             2
--> useplot(1)
-->
\end{verbatim}
