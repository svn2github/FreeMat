First pass - we want to run FreeMat on a cluster, and use rserver...

1.  In principle, we need:
    A. An option that allows the kernel to run the rserver,
       so that we can issue something like:

ssh gn0 'FMKernel -e rserver'
ssh gn1 'FMKernel -e rserver'
ssh gn2 'FMKernel -e rserver'
...
ssh gnM 'FMKernel -e rserver'

    B. A select mechanism that allows you to wait for 
       computations to complete

Second pass - a virtual file system would be nice - but its not
critical...

Back to the first pass.  One issue is that we need to determine 
a port number that can be used.  If the spawning is under FreeMat
control, we can do something like:

ssh gn0 'FMKernel -e rserver 44067'

That means we need FreeMat strings with embeddable quotes.

That's done.

We also need an argument that allows you to execute a command from the cmd
line.
