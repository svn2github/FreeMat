% HILBERT Hilbert Transform
% 
% Usage
% 
% The hilbert function computes the hilbert transform of the argument
% vector or matrix.  The FreeMat hilbert function is compatible with
% the one from the MATLAB API.  This means that the output of the
% hilbert function is the sum of the original function and an
% imaginary signal containing the Hilbert transform of it.  There are
% two syntaxes for the hilbert function.  The first is
% 
%   y = hilbert(x)
% 
% where x is real vector or matrix.  If x is a matrix, then he
% Hilbert transform is computed along the columns of x.  The
% second syntax provides a dimension along which to take the
% transform.
% 
%   y = hilbert(x,n)
% 
% where n is the dimension along which to apply the transformation.
