//@Module SQUEEZE Remove Singleton Dimensions of an Array
//@@Section ARRAY
//@@Usage
//This function removes the singleton dimensions of an array.  The
//syntax for its use is
//@[
//   y = squeeze(x)
//@]
//where @|x| is a multidimensional array.  Generally speaking, if
//@|x| is of size @|d1 x 1 x d2 x ...|, then @|squeeze(x)| is of
//size @|d1 x d2 x ...|, i.e., each dimension of @|x| that was
//singular (size 1) is squeezed out.
//@@Example
//Here is a many dimensioned, ungainly array, both before and 
//after squeezing;
//@<
//x = zeros(1,4,3,1,1,2);
//size(x)
//y = squeeze(x);
//size(y)
//@>
