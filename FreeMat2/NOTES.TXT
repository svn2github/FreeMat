+ - works with help from automake.  Need to move packaging routine into makepkg - see comments in makepkg.in for this one

- prod with complex args returns 0
- images and subplots don't work?
- Add bundle mode to code - where does this go?
- does text help work?
- Check on "@[" in text help
- plot axis rounding
- blas tuning
- extern dependency packaging
- for loop speed
- Check build on mac os X
- Add regression tests to make check target
- Fix "install" target on linux.


- subplots of 1xn don't work
- dist doesn't pick up the generated files.
- Add win32 package to makepkg tool
- Add "help" target to build system and make it work
- ls/dir system doesn't work right
- Need to verify system function on Win32
- win32 build of matio
- matio wierdness

- Source build appears to work on Linux...  

Before release:
- JPG plugins (Win32)
- Handle docs
- about dialog
- Mac
- Save restore state of main window & help window.
- Enable function mode (-f "code") in gui versions.
- paste, ctrl-c/z
- Test packaging

What is the deal with the source release?
  1. Dependency on ATLAS? There appear to be several BLAS options:
       A. Use a prebuilt ATLAS BLAS
       B. Use a custom ATLAS BLAS
       C. Use the system BLAS
       D. Use the reference BLAS
  2. UMFPACK/AMD/UFconfig - Just build these, I think
  3. LAPACK
       A. Use the system LAPACK
       B. Use the included LAPACK
  4. FFCall
       A. Use the system ffcall
       B. Use the included ffcall
  5. FFTW
       A. Use the system fftw
       B. Use the included fftw
  6. Fortran compiler identification (g77 versus gfortran)
       A. Use gfortran
       B. Use g77
  7. Fortran linking (libg2c versus libgfortran)


So we need a configure interface that will handle these various options.

Installer:
  Win   - nsis script done & works
  Mac   - essentially done & works
  Linux - essentially done & works
  Source - needs work


Done:
- Add license.mpp file
- What about the help compiler?  I could just include it in FreeMat...
- Locks up after command appears in history window
- Need finite command recall window
- Save restore state of main window & help window.
- Mac
- Enable function mode (-f "code") in gui versions.
- Closing of only figure window

  100% CPU problem on Win32

FreeMat will be distributed as a bundle.  A bundle contains the following directory structure:

freemat
   \
    bin
    libs
    help
    mfiles

On Mac OS X, the bundle structure is
freemat
   \
    Contents
    \
    Frameworks
    MacOS
    Resources
    PlugIns

We can use a common structure via:

freemat
  \
  Contents
   \
   bin
   lib
   Resources
    \
     mfiles
     help
       \
        html
        pdf
	text
   PlugIns

This means that on any platform, the path to system-included mfiles is
appDir+"../Resources/mfiles"
and that the path to system-included help is
appDir+"../Resources/help"

I like it.

extern dependencies:
  ffcall
  lapack
  atlas
  mkl

packaging
handle documentation

1. Printing
2. SVD
3. Off-by-one errors in axis drawing
4. Ditto in bitmap painting.
5. Need axis command
sca
colorbar
integer limits  
Legend
handleobjects deletion

=======
1.  Finish properties for surface plots - markers & texture mapping?

ACTIVE

IDEAS - auto tick calculation --> paint code
wierdness with plots drawing

>>>>>>> 1.13
4.  Rewrite legend function to use multiple axes
6.  Fix axis limits so that objects aren't truncated...
7.  view - command doesn't work right (also, camera target mode/etc.)
8.  axis annotation for view 2
10. Handle graphics documentation/class documentation
11. prebuilt packaging
15. What about rotation buttons
16. User control of figure sizes
19. Colormap
20. Colorbar
21. Clim
22. Surf/Surfc, imagesc
23. Printing
27. builtin function masking (ala surface.m, for example)
29. Surface gaps
30. Handle axis packing

CLOSED
24. Tick counts
1.  Finish properties for surface plots - markers & texture mapping?
23. subplot --> area of intersection
12. prod(svd(rand(3))) --> core dump
14. plot3
18. OpenGL activation
25. Close notification for figures
26. Raise/show/activate figures
13. Need refresh on set
17. Image sizes
28. Spacing aroung figure


>>>>>>> 1.12
A few notes on what needs to still be fixed:

Replace XERBLA
Fix problems with workspace calculations in DGESDD

Default ticklen is [0.01, 0.025]
Default position is [0.13,0.11,0.775,0.815]


Postscript printing with symbols and super/subscript...
- super and subscript works fine
- postscript printing maps the symbols to unicode
 
set(gca,'xtick',[vec]) 
set(gca,'xlabel',string)
set(gca,'xdir','reverse')


Additional functions that would useful to have:
clf
hot
image args --> MATLAB
set(gca, 'xtick', [], 'ytick', [1 n2])
text(1, 1.04*(n2+0.5), '1', ...
	'horizontalalign', 'left', ...
	'verticalalign', 'top')
text(n1, 1.04*(n2+0.5), num2str(n1), ...
	'horizontalalign', 'right', ...
	'verticalalign', 'top')
axis xy
texts
set(hh, 'CDataMapping', 'direct')
set(gca, 'CLim', clim)
set(gca, 'CLimMode', 'auto')
set(gca, 'TickDir', 'out')
drawnow
if isxy, axis xy, end  <- why doesn't this parse right?


Redraw - under some circumstances plots do not refresh
Broken lines
0 --> 1e-18
image --> causes a figure resize (even when zoom = -1)
svd --> causes a seg fault

P N   Desc
Capital Letters?


Graphics issues:
//copy
//print
//resize
flicker
//point function
drag(?)
//close & new figure numbering
