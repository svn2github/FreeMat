Performance is much better now.  I will make a release soon.  I still want to 
complete the editor/debugger integration.

Problems:
  - close all causes Xlib to bork - fixed (disabled OpenGL renderer)
  - there is some type of leak in the plot code (when hold is used) - not verified
  - having a variable as the only thing on a line doesn't work right - fixed
  - sscanf is missing - fixed
  - variables tool shows wrong values...- fixed
  - 64 bit quantities do not show up correctly - fixed
  - clear libs does not release imported functions - fixed
  - backwards compatibility for native-format data files and 64 bit types

p*o = [4 1 2 3]x
      [1 4 2 3]x 
      [1 2 4 3]x
      [1 2 3 4]

- Fix unterminated strings... - done

- replacement for libMatIO is nearly complete.

64 bit - 
	Analyze.cpp - done
	Cast.cpp - done
	Constructors.cpp - done
	Inspect.cpp - done
	IO.cpp - done
	MatIO.cpp - done
	Misc.cpp - done
	MPIWrap.cpp - done
	Random.cpp - done
	Array.cpp - done
	Class.cpp - done
	FunctionDef.cpp - done
	LUDecompose.cpp - done
	Math.cpp
	Print.cpp - done
	Serialize.cpp - 
	Sparse.cpp 
	HandleCommands.cpp
	HandleProperty.cpp
	MexInterface.cpp
	mxArray.cpp
	VariablesTool.cpp - done

Still To Do (possibly for 2.1 release):

1.  Packaging issues - Need to remember where I left this.
2.  libMatIO replacement
3.  Debugger/Editor integration
4.  GUI documentation

Threading issues...
A.  GUI calls into main thread
B.  Prompt and main routine... how does this work? - seems to work ok
C.  Debug cycles

GUI calls that cause errors... these need to be relayed to the 
interpreter.

Debug cycles... how does this work?

    Completion introduces a race condition... We need to put a mutex
to protect the context.

helpgen - Done
Completion - Done
Context stuff - Done
history widget - feedback into command line history - Done
Workspace widget - Done
files widget - Done
pcode - Done
getline - Done
Initial terminal width. - Done
Stack trace - Done
Continuations - Done
Breakpoints
	- General bps seem to work. - Done
	- check bps on scripts - Done
	- dbstep beyond end of function - Done
	- bp outside valid line range - Done
	- simplify interface? - Done
Quit - Done

OK - 2.0 release is done.  Next steps.

1.  Implement the regression test code
2.  Add more regression tests
3.  Implement GUI objects
4.  Implement more functions
5.  String output wrapping

Continuation and array definition

The new parser/scanner are now set in place, with nearly all of the functionality working.
Some remaining items:
1.  Continuations
2.  Debugger

semilog, loglog
isequal
output autoformatting

2. Check icon for various platforms
3. Update build number in WalkTree.cpp
5. Make check

Current state:

Platform/target     all      help      package     install     dist     check
Linux              done     done        done       done        done     untest
Mac OS X           done     untested   broken(*)   n/a         n/a      untest
Win32              done     untested   untested    n/a         n/a      untest


* Icon doesn't work
build instructions from SVN:
- bootstrap
- make
- make help
- make distcheck


- prod with complex args returns 0
- plot axis rounding
- blas tuning
- for loop speed
- Check build on mac os X
- Add regression tests to make check target
- Fix "install" target on linux.
- csvread, csvwrite

- ls/dir system doesn't work right
- Need to verify system function on Win32
- win32 build of matio
- matio wierdness

- Source build appears to work on Linux...  

Before release:
- JPG plugins (Win32)
- Handle docs
- about dialog
- Mac
- Save restore state of main window & help window.
- Enable function mode (-f "code") in gui versions.
- paste, ctrl-c/z
- Test packaging
- global/persistent

What is the deal with the source release?
  1. Dependency on ATLAS? There appear to be several BLAS options:
       A. Use a prebuilt ATLAS BLAS
       B. Use a custom ATLAS BLAS
       C. Use the system BLAS
       D. Use the reference BLAS
  2. UMFPACK/AMD/UFconfig - Just build these, I think
  3. LAPACK
       A. Use the system LAPACK
       B. Use the included LAPACK
  4. FFCall
       A. Use the system ffcall
       B. Use the included ffcall
  5. FFTW
       A. Use the system fftw
       B. Use the included fftw
  6. Fortran compiler identification (g77 versus gfortran)
       A. Use gfortran
       B. Use g77
  7. Fortran linking (libg2c versus libgfortran)


So we need a configure interface that will handle these various options.

Installer:
  Win   - nsis script done & works
  Mac   - essentially done & works
  Linux - essentially done & works
  Source - needs work


Done:
- Add license.mpp file
- What about the help compiler?  I could just include it in FreeMat...
- Locks up after command appears in history window
- Need finite command recall window
- Save restore state of main window & help window.
- Mac
- Enable function mode (-f "code") in gui versions.
- Closing of only figure window
  GPL 
  BLAS setup (override)
  Quit signaling
  Finish editor
  GUI Console + completions
  colormap wrapping for images
  Installer & packaging
  Source release
  xlabels under linux

  Non-X11 version
  non-gui version - with "x" click

  Missing quads?
  point function?
  setpath

  framework...

  100% CPU problem on Win32

FreeMat will be distributed as a bundle.  A bundle contains the following directory structure:

freemat
   \
    bin
    libs
    help
    mfiles

On Mac OS X, the bundle structure is
freemat
   \
    Contents
    \
    Frameworks
    MacOS
    Resources
    PlugIns

We can use a common structure via:

freemat
  \
  Contents
   \
   bin
   lib
   Resources
    \
     mfiles
     help
       \
        html
        pdf
	text
   PlugIns

This means that on any platform, the path to system-included mfiles is
appDir+"../Resources/mfiles"
and that the path to system-included help is
appDir+"../Resources/help"

I like it.

extern dependencies:
  ffcall
  lapack
  atlas
  mkl

>>>>>>> 1.12
A few notes on what needs to still be fixed:

Replace XERBLA
Fix problems with workspace calculations in DGESDD

Default ticklen is [0.01, 0.025]
Default position is [0.13,0.11,0.775,0.815]


Postscript printing with symbols and super/subscript...
- super and subscript works fine
- postscript printing maps the symbols to unicode
 
set(gca,'xtick',[vec]) 
set(gca,'xlabel',string)
set(gca,'xdir','reverse')


Additional functions that would useful to have:
clf
hot
image args --> MATLAB
set(gca, 'xtick', [], 'ytick', [1 n2])
text(1, 1.04*(n2+0.5), '1', ...
	'horizontalalign', 'left', ...
	'verticalalign', 'top')
text(n1, 1.04*(n2+0.5), num2str(n1), ...
	'horizontalalign', 'right', ...
	'verticalalign', 'top')
axis xy
texts
set(hh, 'CDataMapping', 'direct')
set(gca, 'CLim', clim)
set(gca, 'CLimMode', 'auto')
set(gca, 'TickDir', 'out')
drawnow
if isxy, axis xy, end  <- why doesn't this parse right?


Redraw - under some circumstances plots do not refresh
Broken lines
0 --> 1e-18
image --> causes a figure resize (even when zoom = -1)
svd --> causes a seg fault

P N   Desc
Capital Letters?


Graphics issues:
//copy
//print
//resize
flicker
//point function
drag(?)
//close & new figure numbering
