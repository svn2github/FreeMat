A few notes on what needs to still be fixed:

Replace XERBLA
Fix problems with workspace calculations in DGESDD

Default ticklen is [0.01, 0.025]
Default position is [0.13,0.11,0.775,0.815]


Postscript printing with symbols and super/subscript...
- super and subscript works fine
- postscript printing maps the symbols to unicode
 
set(gca,'xtick',[vec]) 
set(gca,'xlabel',string)
set(gca,'xdir','reverse')


Additional functions that would useful to have:
clf
hot
image args --> MATLAB
set(gca, 'xtick', [], 'ytick', [1 n2])
text(1, 1.04*(n2+0.5), '1', ...
	'horizontalalign', 'left', ...
	'verticalalign', 'top')
text(n1, 1.04*(n2+0.5), num2str(n1), ...
	'horizontalalign', 'right', ...
	'verticalalign', 'top')
axis xy
texts
set(hh, 'CDataMapping', 'direct')
set(gca, 'CLim', clim)
set(gca, 'CLimMode', 'auto')
set(gca, 'TickDir', 'out')
drawnow
if isxy, axis xy, end  <- why doesn't this parse right?


Redraw - under some circumstances plots do not refresh
Broken lines
0 --> 1e-18
image --> causes a figure resize (even when zoom = -1)
svd --> causes a seg fault
