Installation is pretty basic.  Assuming you have a reasonable system
setup, the following should work..

First unpack the source tar file

   tar xvfz FreeMat-1.0.tar.gz

Next, we make a build directory under the FreeMat-1.0 source directory.

   cd FreeMat-1.0
   mkdir build
   cd build

Now, we run configure.  Remember to use configure -help for more options.

   ../configure

Then a make and a make install.

   make
   make install

Note that if you do not change the --prefix directory when running 
configure, that installation takes place in /usr/local. There are 
two post-build steps you must still (manually) perform.
   1. Add /usr/local/FreeMat to the PATH
   2. Add a FREEMAT_PATH environment variable to your startup 
         files that includes /usr/local/FreeMat/MFiles

For example, with .csh, the following line would be added to the .cshrc

setenv FREEMAT_PATH /usr/local/FreeMat/MFiles:/home/user/myMFiles

It is not necessary to add the "." directory to the search path, as it
is automatically searched by FreeMat. 

Note also that FreeMat uses LAPACK and BLAS as part of its matrix
manipulation routines.  During the configure process, FreeMat will
attempt to find an optimized BLAS/LAPACK.  If it fails, you can either
specify a location using the --with-blas and --with-lapack options to
configure, or use the provided blas and lapack using the --with-miniblas
and --with-minilapack options.  These should be used as a last resort.
They are unoptimized versions that will generally result in less than
ideal performance of FreeMat.  I recommend the ATLAS project 
(math-atlas.sourceforge.net) to generate an automatically tuned
set of BLAS routines for your specific machine.
