Installation should (hopefully) be as simple as a 

./configure
make

The current build does not install itself.  To install the resulting
code, copy the binary and the manual to somewhere on your path:

cp src/FreeMat /usr/local/FreeMat/bin
cp manual/manual/manual.zip /usr/local/FreeMat/bin

You may also want to put the contents of MFiles somewhere:

mkdir /usr/local/FreeMat
cp -R MFiles /usr/local/FreeMat/.

The final step is to add an environment variable FREEMAT_PATH to
that includes a colon-delimited list of paths for FreeMat to search.
For example, with .csh, the following line would be added to the .cshrc

setenv FREEMAT_PATH /usr/local/FreeMat/MFiles:/home/user/myMFiles

It is not necessary to add the "." directory to the search path, as it
is automatically searched by FreeMat.  Note that you currently must 
execute "./configure make" in the top source directory for the compile to 
succeed.  Although the FreeMat code can
be built in a seperate directory, many of the included libraries cannot.

Note also that FreeMat uses LAPACK and BLAS as part of its matrix
manipulation routines.  During the configure process, FreeMat will
attempt to find an optimized BLAS/LAPACK.  If it fails, you can either
specify a location using the --with-blas and --with-lapack options to
configure, or use the provided blas and lapack using the --with-miniblas
and --with-minilapack options.  These should be used as a last resort.
They are unoptimized versions that will generally result in less than
ideal performance of FreeMat.  I recommend the ATLAS project 
(math-atlas.sourceforge.net) to generate an automatically tuned
set of BLAS routines for your specific machine.
