Installation is pretty basic.  Assuming you have a reasonable system
setup, the following should work. Also note that the following explanation refers to version 1.0 ; for newer versions simply substitute 1.0 with the new version number.

First unpack the source tar file

   tar xvfz FreeMat-1.0.tar.gz

or using

   gunzip FreeMat-1.0.tar.gz
   tar -xvf FreeMat-1.0.tar

This will create a new directory FreeMat-1.0 containing all the FreeMat files.
Next, we make a build directory under the FreeMat-1.0 source directory.

   cd FreeMat-1.0
   mkdir build
   cd build

Now, we run configure (use configure -help for more options) :

   ../configure --prefix=<mydir>

where <mydir> is the directory under which FreeMat will be installed. 
The default directory is /usr/local but this requires administrator 
privileges. The simplest solution is to use your own home directory, such as:

   ../configure --prefix=/home/username

In this case, FreeMat will be installed in /home/username/share/FreeMat.
Then, staying inside the build directory, perform a make and a make install:

   make
   make install

There are two post-build steps you must still (manually) perform.
      Add a FREEMAT_PATH environment variable to your startup 
      files that includes /home/username/share/FreeMat/MFiles

For example, with tcsh/csh, the following line would be added to the .cshrc

setenv FREEMAT_PATH /home/username/share/FreeMat/MFiles:/home/username/myMFiles

or in bashrc for bash:

declare -x "FREEMAT_PATH=/home/username/share/FreeMat/MFiles:/home/username/myMFiles"

It is not necessary to add the "." directory to the search path, as it
is automatically searched by FreeMat. 

Note also that FreeMat uses BLAS as part of its matrix
manipulation routines.  During the configure process, FreeMat will
attempt to find an optimized BLAS.  If it fails, you can either
specify a location using the --with-blas option to
configure, or use the provided blas using the --with-miniblas
option.  This should be used as a last resort.
It is an unoptimized version that will generally result in less than
ideal performance of FreeMat.  I recommend the ATLAS project 
(math-atlas.sourceforge.net) to generate an automatically tuned
set of BLAS routines for your specific machine.

After installation, an HTML version of the manual is available by pointing
a web browser to /home/username/share/FreeMat/html/index.html.

Note: On Mac OS X, you will need to install g77 and libjpeg, libpng and 
libtif.  I suggest using fink (fink.sourceforge.net).  Perhaps at some 
point in the future a fink package will be available for the 
Mac (volunteers?).
