What would it take to eliminate wxWindows from FreeMat??  
There are several key areas where wxWindows provides support that 
FLTK (example) does not:

1.  Library support
   ->  dlopen is standard and easy.  Under win32, a loadlibrary command works just as easily.
2.  Postscript support
   ->  This isn't too bad - although it was nice to have 
3.  Image support
   ->  Link directly to libjpeg, libtiff, etc.
4.  System support
   ->  Must implement wxExecute, etc
5.  Help support
   ->  Need HTML support
6.  Drawing support
   ->  Direct drawing support...
7.  Path support
   ->  Not such a biggie - this might exist in fltk also...
8.  Dialogs
   ->  These exist in FLTK - in fact, support for fonts is much better in FLTK


Another idea would be to not use any library - just direct programming....  I _do_ like this idea.
Especially since if I fix problems 1-8, I won't be using much of the toolkit capabilities anyway.
I get the built-in dialogs, fast performance, etc...  Most importantly, it would be fun.

What do I need to make this work? For the Non-GUI version, what I need is to write a little 
application that starts from the command line, and that can open windows.  For the GUI version, 
its more complicated...
