Changes in 1.1.4 (9 February 2006)
* Changed Licensing from the GNU General Public License to the GNU Lesser
  General Public License.
* Added support for reading numeric version 4 MAT files
* Added support for sparse datatypes other than double.  Although Matlab does
  not support these types, other free software does.
* Writing compressed variables is supported for Numeric arrays.  Future versions
  will implement character,sparse,cell, and structure arrays.
* A fortran 90/95 interface has been incorporated.  Not all functions are
  implemented yet, but more will come and it is at least functional now.
  Hopefully feedback will help guide the fortran interface development.
* Replaced preprocessor defines for types,classes,etc. with enum's.
Bug Fixes in 1.1.4 (9 January 2006)
* Mat_VarReadData did not handle complex data
