CLOSEIMAGE Close Image Window

USAGE

Closes an image window, either the currently active window, a 
window with a specific handle, or all image windows.  The general
syntax for its use is

   closeimage(handle)

in which case the image window with the speicified handle is
closed.  Alternately, issuing the command with no argument

   closeimage

is equivalent to closing the currently active image window.  Finally
the command

   closeimage('all')

closes all image windows currently open.
