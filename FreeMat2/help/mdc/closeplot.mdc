CLOSEPLOT Close Plot Window

USAGE

Closes an plot window, either the currently active window, a 
window with a specific handle, or all plot windows.  The general
syntax for its use is

   closeplot(handle)

in which case the plot window with the speicified handle is
closed.  Alternately, issuing the command with no argument

   closeplot

is equivalent to closing the currently active plot window.  Finally
the command

   closeplot('all')

closes all plot windows currently open.
