E Euler Constant (Base of Natural Logarithm)

USAGE

Returns a double (64-bit floating point number) value that represents Euler's constant, the base of the natural logarithm.  Typical usage 

   y = e

This value is approximately 2.718281828459045.

EXAMPLE

The following example demonstrates the use of the e function.

$
--> e
ans = 
  <double>  - size: [1 1]
    2.718281828459045      
--> log(e)
ans = 
  <double>  - size: [1 1]
