FSCANF Formatted File Input Function (C-Style)

USAGE

Reads values from a file.  The general syntax for its use is

  [a1,...,an] = fscanf(handle,format)

Here format is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the input.  Each value that is parsed from
the file described by handle occupies one output slot.
See printf for a description of the format.
