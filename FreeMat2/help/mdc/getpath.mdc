USAGE

Returns a string containing the current FreeMat search path.  The general syntax for
its use is

  y = getpath

The delimiter between the paths depends on the system being used.  For Win32, the
delimiter is a semicolon.  For all other systems, the delimiter is a colon.

@Example
The getpath function is straightforward.

$
--> getpath
ans = 
  <string>  - size: [1 27]
