NEWPLOT New Plot Window Function

USAGE

Creates a new window for the display of plots using the plot commands.
The general syntax for its use is

   y = newplot

where y is the handle (or plot number) of the newly created window.  
Plot handles are sequential, starting with 1, unless one is closed, in 
which case the smallest unused handle is returned.
