    //*
    //*  SGEEVX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
    //*  eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.
    //*
    //*  Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
    //*  the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
    //*  SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
    //*  (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right
    //*  eigenvectors (RCONDV).
    //*
    //*  The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
    //*                   A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
    //*  where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
    //*  The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
    //*                u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
    //*  where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate transpose of u(j).
    //*
    //*  The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
    //*  equal to 1 and largest component real.
    //*
    //*  Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
    //*  more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
    //*  transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
    //*  make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
    //*  of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
    //*  reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
    //*  Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
    //*  (in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
    //*  explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK
    //*  Users' Guide.

    //*                 upper triangular. Do not diagonally scale;
    //*          = 'S': Diagonally scale the matrix, i.e. replace A by

    //*                 to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
    //*                 norm. Do not permute;
    //*          = 'B': Both diagonally scale and permute A.
    //*
    //*          Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the matrix
    //*          after balancing and/or permuting. Permuting does not change

    //     $                   RCONDV, WORK, LWORK, RWORK, INFO )
    //*  Purpose
    //*  =======
    //*
    //*  ZGEEVX computes for an N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrix A, the
    //*  eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.
    //*
    //*  Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
    //*  the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
    //*  SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
    //*  (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right
    //*  eigenvectors (RCONDV).
    //*
    //*  The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
    //*                   A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
    //*  where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
    //*  The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
    //*                u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
    //*  where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate transpose of u(j).
    //*
    //*  The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
    //*  equal to 1 and largest component real.
    //*
    //*  Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
    //*  more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
    //*  transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
    //*  make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
    //*  of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
    //*  reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
    //*  Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
    //*  (in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
    //*  explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK
    //*  Users' Guide.
    //*
    //*  Arguments
    //*  =========
    //*
    //*  BALANC  (input) CHARACTER*1
    //*          Indicates how the input matrix should be diagonally scaled
    //*          and/or permuted to improve the conditioning of its
    //*          eigenvalues.
    //*          = 'N': Do not diagonally scale or permute;
    //*          = 'P': Perform permutations to make the matrix more nearly
    //*                 upper triangular. Do not diagonally scale;
    //*          = 'S': Diagonally scale the matrix, ie. replace A by
    //*                 D*A*D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix chosen
    //*                 to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
    //*                 norm. Do not permute;
    //*          = 'B': Both diagonally scale and permute A.
    //*
    //*          Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the matrix
    //*          after balancing and/or permuting. Permuting does not change
    //*          condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but balancing does.
