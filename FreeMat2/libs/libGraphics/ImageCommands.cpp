  //@Module COLORMAP Image Colormap Function
  //@@Section IMAGE
  //@@Usage
  //Changes the colormap used for the display of the indexed (scalar) images in
  //the currently active image window.  The generic syntax for its use is
  //@[
  //  colormap(map)
  //@]
  //where @|map| is a 768 element array (usually organized as @|3 \times 256|),
  //which defines the RGB (Red Green Blue) coordinates for each color in the
  //colormap.
  //@@Function Internals
  //Assuming that the contents of the colormap function argument @|c| are 
  //labeled as:
  //\[
  //  c = \begin{bmatrix}
  //    r_1 & g_1 & b_1 \			\
  //    r_1 & g_2 & b_2 \			\
  //    r_1 & g_3 & b_3 \			\
  //    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots 
  //      \end{bmatrix} 
  //\]
  //then these columns for the RGB coordinates of pixel in the mapped image.
  //Assume that the image occupies the range $[a,b]$.  Then the RGB color 
  //of each pixel depends on the value $x$ via the following integer
  //\[
  //  k = 1 + \lfloor 256 \frac{x-a}{b-a} \rfloor,
  //\]
  //so that a pixel corresponding to image value $x$ will receive RGB color 
  //$[r_k,g_k,b_k]$.
  //Colormaps are generally used to pseudo color images to enhance 
  //visibility of features, etc.
  //@@Examples
  //We start by creating a smoothly varying image of a 2D Gaussian pulse.
  //@<
  //x = linspace(-1,1,512)'*ones(1,512);
  //y = x';
  //Z = exp(-(x.^2+y.^2)/0.3);
  //image(Z);
  //mprintimage('colormap1');
  //@>
  //which we display with the default (grayscale) colormap here.
  //@figure colormap1
  //
  //Next we switch to the @|copper| colormap, and redisplay the image.
  //@<
  //colormap(copper);
  //image(Z);
  //mprintimage('colormap2');
  //@>
  //which results in the following image.
  //@figure colormap2
  //
  //If we capture the output of the @|copper| command and plot it, we obtain
  //the following result:
  //@<
  //a = copper;
  //plot(a);
  //mprintplot('colormap3');
  //@>
  //@figure colormap3
  //
  //Note that in the output that each of the color components are linear functions
  //of the index, with the ratio between the red, blue and green components remaining
  //constant as a function of index.  The result is an intensity map with a copper
  //tint.  We can similarly construct a colormap of our own by defining the 
  //three components seperately.  For example, suppose we take three gaussian
  //curves, one for each color, centered on different parts of the index space:
  //@<
  //t = linspace(0,1,256);
  //A = [exp(-(t-1.0).^2/0.1);exp(-(t-0.5).^2/0.1);exp(-t.^2/0.1)]';
  //plot(A);
  //mprintplot('colormap4');
  //@>
  //@figure colormap4
  //
  //The resulting image has dark bands in it near the color transitions.
  //@<
  //image(Z);
  //colormap(A);
  //mprintimage('colormap5');
  //@>
  //@figure colormap5
  //
  //These dark bands are a result of the nonuniform color intensity, which 
  //we can correct for by renormalizing each color to have the same norm.
  //@<
  //w = sqrt(sum(A'.^2));
  //sA = diag(1./w)*A;
  //plot(A);
  //mprintplot('colormap6');
  //@>
  //@figure colormap6
  //
  //The resulting image has no more dark bands.
  //@<
  //image(Z);

  //@Module WINLEV Image Window-Level Function
  //@@Section IMAGE
  //@@Usage
  //Adjusts the data range used to map the current image to the current
  //colormap.  The general syntax for its use is
  //@[
  //  winlev(window,level)
  //@]
  //where @|window| is the new window, and @|level| is the new level, or
  //@[
  //  winlev
  //@]
  //in which case it returns a vector containing the current window
  //and level for the active image.
  //@@Function Internals
  //FreeMat deals with scalar images on the range of @|[0,1]|, and must
  //therefor map an arbitrary image @|x| to this range before it can
  //be displayed.  By default, the @|image| command chooses 
  //\[
  //  \mathrm{window} = \max x - \min x,
  //\]
  //and
  //\[
  //  \mathrm{level} = \frac{\mathrm{window}}{2}
  //\]
  //This ensures that the entire range of image values in @|x| are 
  //mapped to the screen.  With the @|winlev| function, you can change
  //the range of values mapped.  In general, before display, a pixel @|x|
  //is mapped to @|[0,1]| via:
  //\[
  //   \max\left(0,\min\left(1,\frac{x - \mathrm{level}}{\mathrm{window}}
  //   \right)\right)
  //\]
  //@@Examples
  //The window level function is fairly easy to demonstrate.  Consider
  //the following image, which is a Gaussian pulse image that is very 
  //narrow:
  //@<
  //t = linspace(-1,1,256);
  //xmat = ones(256,1)*t; ymat = xmat';
  //A = exp(-(xmat.^2 + ymat.^2)*100);
  //image(A);
  //mprintimage('winlev1');
  //@>
  //The data range of @|A| is @|[0,1]|, as we can verify numerically:
  //@<
  //min(A(:))
  //max(A(:))
  //@>
  //To see the tail behavior, we use the @|winlev| command to force FreeMat
  //to map a smaller range of @|A| to the colormap.
  //@<
  //image(A);
  //winlev(1e-4,0.5e-4)
  //mprintimage('winlev2');
  //@>
  //The result is a look at more of the tail behavior of @|A|.
  //We can also use the winlev function to find out what the
  //window and level are once set, as in the following example.
  //@<
  //image(A);
  //winlev(1e-4,0.5e-4)

  //This function changes the zoom factor associated with the currently active
  //image.  The generic syntax for its use is

  //  zoom(x)
  //@]
  //where @|x| is the zoom factor to be used.  The exact behavior of the zoom
  //factor is as follows:
  //\begin{itemize}
  //\item @|x>0| The image is zoomed by a factor @|x| in both directions.
  //\item @|x=0| The image on display is zoomed to fit the size of the image window, but
  //  the aspect ratio of the image is not changed.  (see the Examples section for
  //more details).  This is the default zoom level for images displayed with the
  //@|image| command.
  //\item @|x<0| The image on display is zoomed to fit the size of the image window, with
  //  the zoom factor in the row and column directions chosen to fill the entire window.
  //  The aspect ratio of the image is not preserved.  The exact value of @|x| is
  //  irrelevant.
  //\end{itemize}
  //@@Example
  //To demonstrate the use of the @|zoom| function, we create a rectangular image 
  //of a Gaussian pulse.  We start with a display of the image using the @|image|
  //command, and a zoom of 1.
  //@<

  //@figure zoom1
  //
  //At this point, resizing the window accomplishes nothing, as with a zoom factor 
  //greater than zero, the size of the image is fixed.
  //
  //If we change the zoom to another factor larger than 1, we enlarge the image by
  //the specified factor (or shrink it, for zoom factors @|0 < x < 1|.  Here is the
  //same image zoomed out to 60%
  //@<
  //image(Z);

  //mprintimage zoom3

  //mprintimage zoom4

  //The ``free'' zoom of @|x = 0| results in the image being zoomed to fit the window
  //without changing the aspect ratio.  The image is zoomed as much as possible in
