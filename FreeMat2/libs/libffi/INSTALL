This is a snapshot of libffi from the GCC CVS tree at 2002-01-19. This is
*NOT* an official release of libffi, but is provided as a convenience for those
who'd like to test a libffi-enabled version of PyObjC.

To install:

* mkdir build
* cd build
* ../configure --prefix=${SOME_CONVENIENT_PLACE} 
* make
* ./ffitest
* make install

The ${SOME_CONVENIENT_PLACE} need not be the usual place for installing software
(/usr/local). After building PyObjC you can even remove this again, as the
bridge does not have a runtime dependency on the installed libffi.
