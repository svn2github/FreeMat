\subsection{ABS Absolute Value Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Returns the absolute value of the input array for all elements.  The 
general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = abs(x)
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensional array of numerical type.  The output 
is the same numerical type as the input, unless the input is \verb|complex|
or \verb|dcomplex|.  For \verb|complex| inputs, the absolute value is a floating
point array, so that the return type is \verb|float|.  For \verb|dcomplex|
inputs, the absolute value is a double precision floating point array, so that
the return type is \verb|double|.
\subsubsection{Example}
The following demonstrates the \verb|abs| applied to a complex scalar.
\begin{verbatim}
--> abs(3+4*i)
ans =
  <float>  - size: [1 1]
    5.0000000
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|abs| function applied to integer and real values:
\begin{verbatim}
--> abs([-2,3,-4,5])
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 4]
  
Columns 1 to 4
             2              3              4              5
\end{verbatim}
For a double-precision complex array,
\begin{verbatim}
--> abs([2.0+3.0*i,i])
ans =
  <double>  - size: [1 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    3.605551242828369         1.000000000000000
\end{verbatim}
