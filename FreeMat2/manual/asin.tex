\subsection{ASIN Inverse Trigonometric Arcsine Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Computes the \verb|asin| function for its argument.  The general
syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  y = asin(x)
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensional array of numerical type.
Integer types are promoted to the \verb|double| type prior to
calculation of the \verb|asin| function.  Output $y$ is of the
same size and type as the input $x$, (unless $x$ is an
integer, in which case $y$ is a \verb|double| type).  
\subsubsection{Function Internals}
Mathematically, the \verb|asin| function is defined for all 
arguments $x$ as
\[ 
   \mathrm{asin} x \equiv - i \log \left(i x + 
   \sqrt{1-x^2}\right).
\]
For real valued variables $x$ in the range $[-1,1]$, the function is
computed directly using the standard C library's numerical \verb|asin|
function. For both real and complex arguments $x$, note that generally
$\mathrm{asin}(\sin(x)) \neq x$, due to the periodicity of $\sin(x)$.
\subsubsection{Example}
The following code demonstates the \verb|asin| function over the range 
$[-1,1]$.
\begin{verbatim}
--> t = linspace(-1,1);
--> plot(t,asin(t))
\end{verbatim}
\doplot{width=8cm}{asinplot}
