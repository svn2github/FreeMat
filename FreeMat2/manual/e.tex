\subsection{E Euler Constant (Base of Natural Logarithm)}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Returns a \verb|double| (64-bit floating point number) value that represents $e$, the base of the natural logarithm.  Typical usage 
\begin{verbatim}
   y = e
\end{verbatim}
This value is approximately $2.718281828459045$.
\subsubsection{Example}
The following example demonstrates the use of the \verb|e| function.
\begin{verbatim}
--> e
ans =
  <double>  - size: [1 1]
    2.718281828459045
--> log(e)
ans =
  <double>  - size: [1 1]
    1.000000000000000
\end{verbatim}
