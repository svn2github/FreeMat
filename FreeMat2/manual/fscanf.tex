\subsection{FSCANF Formatted File Input Function (C-Style)}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Reads values from a file.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  [a1,...,an] = fscanf(handle,format)
\end{verbatim}
Here \verb|format| is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the input.  Each value that is parsed from
the file described by \verb|handle| occupies one output slot.
