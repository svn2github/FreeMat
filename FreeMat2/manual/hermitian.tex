\subsection{HERMITIAN Matrix Hermitian (Conjugate Transpose) Operator}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Computes the Hermitian of the argument (a 2D matrix).  The syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  y = a';
\end{verbatim}
where $a$ is a $M \times N$ numerical matrix.  The output $y$ is a numerical matrix
of the same type of size $N \times M$.  This operator is the conjugating transpose,
which is different from the transpose operator \verb|.'| (which does not 
conjugate complex values).
\subsubsection{Function Internals}
The Hermitian operator is defined simply as
\[
  y_{i,j} = \overline{a_{j,i}}
\]
where $y_{i,j}$ is the element in the $i$th row and $j$th column of the output matrix $y$.
\subsubsection{Examples}
A simple transpose example:
\begin{verbatim}
--> A = [1,2,0;4,1,-1]
A =
  <int32>  - size: [2 3]
  
Columns 1 to 3
             1              2              0
             4              1             -1
--> A'
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [3 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
             1              4
             2              1
             0             -1
\end{verbatim}
Here, we use a complex matrix to demonstrate how the Hermitian operator conjugates the entries.
\begin{verbatim}
--> A = [1+i,2-i]
A =
  <complex>  - size: [1 2]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    1.0000000         1.0000000     i     2.0000000        -1.0000000     i
--> A.'
ans =
  <complex>  - size: [2 1]
  
Columns 1 to 1
    1.0000000        -1.0000000     i
    2.0000000         1.0000000     i
\end{verbatim}
