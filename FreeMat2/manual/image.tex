\subsection{IMAGE Image Display Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Displays a scalar (grayscale or colormapped) image on the 
currently active image window.  The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  image(x)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|x| is a 2-Dimensional numeric matrix containing the
image to be displayed.  The data is autoscaled by default to occupy
the entire colormap or grayscale-space.  The image must be real valued,
but can be non-square.  For zooming the image in or out, use the
\verb|zoom| command.
\subsubsection{Example}
In this example, we create an image that is $512 \times 512$ pixels
square, and set the background to a noise pattern.  We set the central
$128 \times 256$ pixels to be white.
\begin{verbatim}
--> x = rand(512);
--> x((-64:63)+256,(-128:127)+256) = 1.0;
--> newimage
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 1]
             1
--> image(x)
\end{verbatim}

The resulting image looks like:

\doplot{width=6cm}{image1}
