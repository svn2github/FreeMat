\subsection{INT8 Convert to Signed 8-bit Integer}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Converts the argument to an signed 8-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = int8(x)
\end{verbatim}
where $x$ is an $n$-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows the general C rules (e.g., if $x$ is outside the normal
range for a signed 8-bit integer of $[-128,127]$, the least significant
8 bits of $x$ are used after conversion to a signed integer).  Note that
both \verb|NaN| and \verb|Inf| both map to 0.
\subsubsection{Example}
The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of \verb|int8|.  First, the routine uses
\begin{verbatim}
--> int8(100)
ans =
  <int8>  - size: [1 1]
  100
--> int8(-100)
ans =
  <int8>  - size: [1 1]
 -100
\end{verbatim}
In the next example, an integer outside the range  of the type is passed in.  The result is the 8 least significant bits of the argument.
\begin{verbatim}
--> int8(400)
ans =
  <int8>  - size: [1 1]
 -112
\end{verbatim}
In the next example, a positive double precision argument is passed in.  The result is the signed integer that is closest to the argument.
\begin{verbatim}
--> int8(pi)
ans =
  <int8>  - size: [1 1]
   3
\end{verbatim}
In the next example, a complex argument is passed in.  The result is the signed integer that is closest to the real part of the argument.
\begin{verbatim}
--> int8(5+2*i)
ans =
  <int8>  - size: [1 1]
   5
\end{verbatim}
In the next example, a string argument is passed in.  The string argument is converted into an integer array corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.
\begin{verbatim}
--> int8('helo')
ans =
  <int8>  - size: [1 4]
  
Columns 1 to 4
 104  101  108  111
\end{verbatim}
In the last example, a cell-array is passed in.  For cell-arrays and structure arrays, the result is an error.
\begin{verbatim}
--> int8({4})
Error: Cannot convert cell-arrays to any other type.
\end{verbatim}
