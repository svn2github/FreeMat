\subsection{NEWPLOT New Plot Window Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Creates a new window for the display of plots using the \verb|plot| commands.
The general syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = newplot
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|y| is the handle (or plot number) of the newly created window.  
Plot handles are sequential, starting with 1, unless one is closed, in 
which case the smallest unused handle is returned.
\subsubsection{Example}
Here is an example of the use of \verb|newplot| along with a capture of the
resulting window.
\begin{verbatim}
--> newplot
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 1]
             1
\end{verbatim}
Here is the resulting window.

\doplot{width=5cm}{newplot1}
