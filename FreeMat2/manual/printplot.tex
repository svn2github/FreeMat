\subsection{PRINTPLOT Print an Plot To A File}
\subsubsection{Usage}
This function ``prints'' the currently active plot to a file.  The 
generic syntax for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  printplot(filename)
\end{verbatim}
or, alternately,
\begin{verbatim}
  printplot filename
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|filename| is the (string) filename of the destined file.  The current
plot is then saved to the output file using a format that is determined
by the extension of the filename.  The exact output formats may vary on
different platforms, but generally speaking, the following extensions
should be supported cross-platform:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|jpg|, \verb|jpeg|  --  JPEG file 
\item \verb|ps|, \verb|eps| -- Encapsulated Postscript file 
\item \verb|png| -- Portable Net Graphics file
\end{itemize}
Note that only the plot is printed, \emph{not} the window displaying
the plot.  If you want something like that (essentially a window-capture)
use a seperate utility or your operating system's built in screen
capture ability.
\subsubsection{Example}
Here is a simple example of how the figures in this manual are generated.
\begin{verbatim}
--> x = linspace(-1,1);
--> y = cos(5*pi*x);
--> plot(x,y,'r-');
--> printplot printplot1.eps
--> printplot printplot1.jpg
\end{verbatim}
which creates two plots \verb|printplot1.eps|, which is an Encapsulated
Postscript file, and \verb|printplot1.jpg| which is a JPEG file.

\doplot{width=6cm}{printplot1}
