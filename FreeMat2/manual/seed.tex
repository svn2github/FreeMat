\subsection{SEED Seed the Random Number Generator}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Seeds the random number generator using the given integer seed.  
Changing the seed allows you to choose which pseudo-random
sequence is generated.  The seed takes a single \verb|uint32| value:
\begin{verbatim}
  seed(s)
\end{verbatim}
where $s$ is the seed value.
\subsubsection{Example}
Here's an example of how the seed value can be used to reproduce
a specific random number sequence.
\begin{verbatim}
--> seed(32);
--> rand(1,5)
ans =
  <double>  - size: [1 5]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    0.858889267293040         0.372711154975280
  
Columns 3 to 4
    0.555128777998597         0.955656548991768
  
Columns 5 to 5
    0.736669598011224
--> seed(32);
--> rand(1,5)
ans =
  <double>  - size: [1 5]
  
Columns 1 to 2
    0.858889267293040         0.372711154975280
  
Columns 3 to 4
    0.555128777998597         0.955656548991768
  
Columns 5 to 5
    0.736669598011224
\end{verbatim}
