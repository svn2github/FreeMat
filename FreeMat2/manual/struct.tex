\subsection{STRUCT Structure Array Constructor}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Creates an array of structures from a set of field, value pairs.
The syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
   y = struct(n1,v1,n2,v2,...)
\end{verbatim}
where $n_i$ are the names of the fields in the structure array, and
$v_i$ are the values.  The values $v_i$ must either all be
scalars, or be cell-arrays of all the same dimensions.  In the latter case, the
output structure array will have dimensions dictated by this common
size.  Scalar entries for the $v_i$ are replicated to fill out
their dimensions. An error is raised if the inputs are not properly matched (i.e., are
not pairs of field names and values), or if the size of any two non-scalar
values cell-arrays are different.

\subsubsection{Example}
This example creates a 3-element structure array with two fields, \verb|foo|
and \verb|bar|, where the contents of \verb|foo| are provided explicitly, and
the contents of \verb|bar| are replicated from a scalar.
\begin{verbatim}
--> y = struct('foo',{1,3,4},'bar',{'cheese','cola','beer'},'key',508)
y =
  <structure array> - size: [1 3]
  Fields
    foo
    bar
    key
--> y(1)
ans =
  <structure array> - size: [1 1]
    foo: [1]
    bar: cheese
    key: [508]
--> y(2)
ans =
  <structure array> - size: [1 1]
    foo: [3]
    bar: cola
    key: [508]
--> y(3)
ans =
  <structure array> - size: [1 1]
    foo: [4]
    bar: beer
    key: [508]
\end{verbatim}
