\subsection{TITLE Plot Title Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
This command adds a title to the plot.  The general syntax
for its use is
\begin{verbatim}
  title('label')
\end{verbatim}
or in the alternate form
\begin{verbatim}
  title 'label'
\end{verbatim}
or simply
\begin{verbatim}
  title label
\end{verbatim}
Here \verb|label| is a string variable.
\subsubsection{Example}
Here is an example of a simple plot with a title.
\begin{verbatim}
--> x = linspace(-1,1);
--> y = cos(2*pi*x);
--> plot(x,y,'r-');
--> title('cost over time');
\end{verbatim}
which results in the following plot.

\doplot{width=8cm}{title1}
