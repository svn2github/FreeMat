\subsection{USEIMAGE Use Image Window Function}
\subsubsection{Usage}
Changes the active image window to the specified handle (or image number).  
The general syntax for its use is 
\begin{verbatim}
  useimage(handle)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|handle| is the handle to use.  If the image window corresponding to
\verb|x| does not already exist, a new window with this handle number is 
created.
\subsubsection{Example}
In this example, we create two image windows, and then use the \verb|useimage|
command to activate the first window.
\begin{verbatim}
--> newimage
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 1]
             1
--> newimage
ans =
  <int32>  - size: [1 1]
             2
--> useimage(1)
-->
\end{verbatim}
