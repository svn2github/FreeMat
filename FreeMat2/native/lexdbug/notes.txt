OK - I need to get the lexer straightened out.  The whole idea of MSCAN appears to work.  But the switching in and out of MScan is broken.  Consider the following simple expression:
[(3) -4], which should lex as [(3),-4] with the comma inserted by MSCAN.  
We start in the scanning state.
Now an '[' is encountered.  We push the scanning state onto the stack,
and switch to MScan.
STACK : Scanning <MScan>
Next, we see a '(', and push the current state onto the stack (Mscan),
and switch to Scanning.
STACK : Scanning MScan <Scanning>
Next, we encounter the "3", and push the current state (Scanning) and
switch to TransposeCheck.
STACK : Scanning MScan Scanning <TransposeCheck>
In state TransposeCheck we see that the next token is ')' (and not
a transpose), so we pop the state stack (which puts us back in Scanning
mode), and push back the ')'.
STACK : Scanning MScan <Scanning>
In state Scanning, we see that the next token is ')'.
The top state is not Scanning, so we move to MScan.
STACK : Scanning <MScan>
