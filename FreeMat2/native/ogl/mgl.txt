The FreeMat interface to OpenGL might look something like this:

1.  setup a 3D imaging sphere - of radius n (where n is specified) - this value will 
control the nRange value in ChangeSize.
2.  Somehow, it must be possible to separate construction of the scene from the rendering...
It is possible with call lists... but this is inefficient.  A cleaner approach is to 
use vertex lists if supported.  Or to build some type of intermediate GL.
