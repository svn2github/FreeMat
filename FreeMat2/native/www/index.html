<span> Introduction </span>
</h1>
<p>
FreeMat is a free environment for rapid engineering and scientific
prototyping and data processing.  It is similar to commercial systems
such as MATLAB from Mathworks, and IDL from Research Systems, but is
Open Source.  FreeMat includes several novel features such as a
codeless interface to external C/C++/FORTRAN code,
parallel/distributed algorithm development (via MPI), and plotting and
visualization capabilities.  FreeMat is available under the GPL license.  Supported platforms include Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

</p>

<h1 class="newsheading">
<span class="newtitle">FreeMat 2.0</span>
<span class="newsdate">6-5-2006</span>&nbsp;
</h1>
<p>
I have elected to release FreeMat 2.0.  Here is a list of some of the changes
<ul>
<li> I have reverted to the autotools build system.
<li> Many new MATLAB-compatibility functions and scripts (special thanks to M. Vogel for the help).
<li> Fixed bugs in the range operator
<li> Rewrote the output format code
<li> Added the noplastique flag
<li> Fixed text help on all platforms
<li> Added support for traditional Linux install (non package based)
</ul>
The new release is available in the downloads section as always.  Some
comments on the Mac release.  I have switched to Mac OS X Tiger (10.4)
as the build platform. However, I have yet to have success building
FreeMat as a Universal Binary.  I will continue to work on a Universal
Binary for a future release (any help is greatly appreciated).  

There are also some new screenshots of 2.0 on the various platforms in the
screenshots area.

<span class="newtitle">FreeMat 2.0 Release Candidate</span>
<span class="newsdate">3-12-2006</span>&nbsp;
</h1>
<div class="news">
<img src="news.gif"></img>
<p>
Its been nearly a year (!) since the last release of FreeMat.  A new version is now ready for testing.  I have elected to release it as a Release Candidate instead of a full release because of the significant changes that have been made since version 1.10.  Here is just a short list of the new features.
<ul>
<li> Handle-based Graphics including 3D surface plots, multiple plots per figure, and full customization of axes properties.  Preliminary support for OpenGL rendering.  
<li> Support for MATLAB-style classes and object oriented programming, including operator overloading.
<li> New GUI interface based on Qt4.  FreeMat now sports a new terminal interface, a highlighting editor, and some new tools.
<li> Speed improvements and optimizations (some loops are 10-100 times faster).
<li> Preliminary support for reading and writing MATLAB .MAT files.
<li> PDF output on all platforms.
<li> New build system based on qmake.
<li> Many new MATLAB-compatibility functions and scripts.
<li> Native Aqua application on Mac OS X.
<li> Linux distribution now includes a binary release that should run on several distributions.
<li> Over 200 new pages of documentation, and an improved built in help browser.
</ul>
The new release of FreeMat is under the GNU Public License.  The following features are no longer supported or are not supported in this Release Candidate.
<ul>
<li> The copy function has changed for figures.  It is now based on bitmaps, even on Win32 (where it used to copy a vector drawing).
<li> The MPI interface does not build in this RC1.  I will fix this for the 2.0 release.
</ul>
Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release (see the About FreeMat dialog for a list).

<h1 class="newsheading">
<span class="newtitle">Source Code Update for FreeMat 1.10</span>
<span class="newsdate">3-16-2005</span>&nbsp;
</h1>
<div class="news">
<img src="news.gif"></img>
<p>
A problem compiling FreeMat under RedHat 9, and  other distros was reported (thanks to Kevin Somervill for the patch).  An updated source code tarball has been posted to the downloads page.  This change only affects people building FreeMat from source (and for whom the original 1.10 package failed to build).

<p>
A new release of FreeMat is available for download (version 1.10).  Please consider making a   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=91526"> donation </a> to the project - it would help offset the costs of developing and maintaining FreeMat for multiple platforms (particularly the non-Linux ones).  This version features significant improvements over version 1.09.  The major changes are listed below. 
<ul>
<li> Sparse matrix support - Thanks to Al Danial for help with this one.  FreeMat now supports most of the sparse matrix functionality of Matlab, including the creation and manipulation of sparse matrices, the solution of sparse linear problems (via UMFPACK), and sparse eigenproblems (via ARPACK).
<li> More linear algebra - Including LU factorizations for full and sparse (square) matrices.
<li> Debug support - You can now debug FreeMat routines efficiently using the dbstep, dbstop, dbauto, dblist and other debug related routines.  See the chapter on Debug functions in the manual for more information.  A debug tutorial may appear in a future version.
<li> Improved compatibility - A number of support functions (e.g., mod, unique, sort, etc.) are now available in FreeMat
<li> Boolean shortcut evaluation - FreeMat now implements boolean shortcut expressions
<li> GUI Enhancements - The GUI has some usability enhancements (partial command recall, font size preference, etc).
<li> Many, many bug fixes - Thanks to Jeff Fessler, Bruno De Man, Brian Yanoff and others for the bug reports and scripts.
</ul>

<p>
I should have known better.  A week or two have come and gone, and a new version of FreeMat is still not ready.  I have run into problems building it on Fedora Core 3, and until I get the build process working on all platforms again, I will have to wait.  It should be soon (see?  I'm a quick learner.)

<p>
Its been quite a while since the last release of FreeMat.  Just though I'd post a quick note to let everyone know what is happening.  I have been working on version 1.10 for some time now.  It features some significant feature enhancements (the most notable one being support for sparse matrices) as well as a number of bug fixes.  I will likely release 1.10 in the next week or two.

<p>
A new release of FreeMat is available for download (version 1.09).  This release fixes a few bugs in FreeMat that were severe enough to warrant a quick release:
<ul>
<li> The GUI window can now be closed without causing FreeMat to hang.
<li> On start up of the GUI version of FreeMat, the CPU usage is no longer pegged at 100%.
<li> Using the down arrow in command line recall for the Linux version (non-GUI) caused a core dump if the line had been modified.  This is now fixed.
</ul>

<span class="newsdate">10-12-2004</span>&nbsp;
</h1>
<div class="news">
<img src="news.gif"></img>
<p>
Just to reemphasize a couple of issues that have come up since the 1.08 release.
<ul>
<li>  There was a bug in 1.07's save command that makes the files not load correctly in 1.08 (and not even in 1.07 under certan circumstances).  I do not have a conversion utility available, but if there is demand for one, I can provide one.
<li>  The documentation for the image command stated that the default zoom for an image was 0, when in fact it was 1.  In 1.08, the default zoom is 0, as was claimed in the documentation.  This may cause some problems if you wrote routines that assumed it was 1.
<li>  The functions newplot,useplot,newimage,useimage,printplot,printimage have all been replaced with figure and print.  While no backwards compatibility scripts were provided (and indeed, the exact behavior of the original functions is difficult to reproduce), I can make such scripts available if required.
<li>  Do not close the GUI window to quit FreeMat.  Use the quit command.  This bug will be fixed in the next release.
</ul>

<p>
A new release of FreeMat is available for download (version 1.08).  There are significant changes under the hood, but from a user's perspective, this is primarily a bug fix and feature release.  There are a few changes that are noticeable, however, and they are listed here.
<ul>
<li> The functions newplot,useplot,newimage,and useimage have all been replaced with the figure command (similar to Matlab).
<li> A new cross-platform GUI is now available on all supported platforms.  For Linux/Unix variants, try starting FreeMat with a "-gui" option to access the new GUI.
<li> Online help is now available on OS X.
<li> The X11 server is no longer used on OS X.
<li> Figure windows on Win32 no longer have "save" and "copy" options.  This functionality is achieved using the "print" and "copy" commands, respectively.
<li> FreeMat now uses the excellent FLTK (http://www.fltk.org) toolkit to provide graphical services.
<li> A number of bug fixes and feature enhancements.
</ul>
Special thanks to Bruno DeMan for extensive testing, suggestions, bug reports, and an improved README!

Jeremy Gill has been kind enough to provide an RPM for FreeMat 1.06 (it is a Red Hat 8.0 RPM - I do not know what other systems it may or may not install on).  An RPM for Fedora Core 2 should be available when FreeMat 1.07 is released.  Jeremy's RPM is available in the download section.  Also, special thanks to Brian Yanoff for the many excellent bug reports and feature requests!

I found a few critical bugs in FreeMat 1.05 that warranted a quick new release to fix them.  The documentation has not changed (only one function, mpiallreduce has been added, and I do not have any significant documentation for it yet).  Note also that MPI capability is currently only available for source builds.

A new release of FreeMat is available for download (version 1.05).  This is a combination of a bug-fix release as well as the first release to support the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel computing.  This version also sports significantly enhanced error reporting and a variety of additional features.  Last, but not least, FreeMat is now available as a Mac OS X bundle for easy installation.

<p>
Just to update everyone on where things stand.  I have uploaded an update of FreeMat (1.04) that
was intended to bring the MPI parallel programming capability of FreeMat into the stable version
(it has been present in the developer version for some time).  However, I ran into some problems
in the final testing, and so the web site download page still points to 1.03.  The remaining issues
have been subsequently fixed (along with a host of other minor bug fixes), and the 1.05 release
will be released soon.
