This is the Mac OS X bundle of FreeMat 1.05.  Installation should be
just like any other Mac application.  One requirement, however, is that
you have XWindow installed.  It is available for free from Apple's 
web site at http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/download.  If you
need help with FreeMat, or find a bug to report, please go to
http://freemat.sf.net
There is an online help system (just type "help <topic>" inside FreeMat),
as well as an HTML help.  I haven't figured out how to integrate the
bundled help yet, so I suggest the PDF version of the help, available
for download at http://freemat.sf.net (and bundled in this drive image).
