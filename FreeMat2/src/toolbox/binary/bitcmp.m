% BITCMP BITCMP Bitwise Boolean Complement Operation
% 
% Usage
% 
% Performs a bitwise binary complement operation on the argument and
% returns the result.  The syntax for its use is
% 
%    y = bitcmp(a)
% 
% where a is an unsigned integer arrays.  This version of the command
% uses as many bits as required by the type of a.  For example, if 
% a is an uint8 type, then the complement is formed using 8 bits.
% The second form of bitcmp allows you to specify the number of bits
% to use, 
% 
%    y = bitcmp(a,n)
% 
% in which case the complement is taken with respect to n bits, where n must be 
% less than the length of the integer type.
% bitcmp_cpp, referenced by this function, is a c++ implementation implemented for
% computational speed, which takes a single argument.
