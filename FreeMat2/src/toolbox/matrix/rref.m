%@Module RREF Reduced Row Echelon Form of a Matrix
%@@Section ARRAY
%@@Usage
%Calculates the reduced row echelon form of a matrix using Gauss
%Jordan elimination with partial pivoting.  The generic syntax
%for @|rref| is 
%@[
%   R = rref(A)
%@]
%A default tolerance of @|max(size(A))*eps*norm(A,inf)| is used to
%detect negligible column elements.  The second form of @|rref| 
%returns a vector @|k| as well as @|R|
%@[
%  [R,k] = rref(A)
%@]
%where @|k| is a vector that correponds to the columns of @|A| 
%used as pivot columns.  If you want to control the tolerance
%used to identify negligible elements, you can use the form
%@[
%  [R,k] = rref(A, tolerance)
%@]
%This implementation of @|rref| is based on the one from 
%the matcompat lib for octave.  It is copyright Paul Kienzle,
%and distributed under the GNU GPL.

% rref   Reduced row echelon form
%      R = rref (A, tol) returns the reduced row echelon form of a.
%      tol defaults to eps * max (size (A)) * norm (A, inf)
%
%      [R, k] = rref (...) returns the vector of "bound variables",
%      which are those columns on which elimination has been performed.
