---- Draft FLTK 1.1.5 Release Announcement ----

The FLTK Team is proud to announce the release of FLTK 1.1.5,
a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.

The FLTK 1.1.5 release is primarily a bug-fix release including
documentation updates, fixes for 64-bit platforms, FLUID,
several widgets, and GLUT emulation, and fixes for several
platform-specific issues. The new release also adds project
files for Visual C++.NET and supports KDE 3.x icons.

FLTK is provided under the GNU Library Public License with
exceptions that allow for static linking.

	  text (italic next to plain, etc.) properly (STR #381)

	- Fl_File_Chooser did not handle some cases for filename
	  completion (STR #376)

	  CTRL-A shortcut to move to the first column, since
	  there is a key for that and the widget does not

	  set to plastic and the box type is a frame (STR #205)
	- Fl_Window::resize() did not work properly with KDE 3.2
	  (STR #356)
	- FLTK didn't delete font bitmaps when the last OpenGL
	  window was deleted, preventing future text from
	  displaying (STR #310)

	  the trailing NULL menu items (STR #375)

	  background (STR #204)
	- Fl_Scroll now shows the background image when a framed
	  box type is used and the Fl_Scroll is a direct
	  decendent of a window (STR #205)
	- Added a new_directory_tooltip string pointer to allow
	  localization of the file chooser's new directory
	  button (STR #340)

	- Fl_Help_Dialog didn't correctly restore the scroll
	  position when going forward/back in the link history
	  if the file changed (STR #218)

	  confusing some GLUT-based applications (STR #213)

	  #229)
