Options:

1. Take inspiration from python, and nothing else.
   Pros: No concerns about shoe-horning
   Cons: Lots of work - no real multiplicative effect

2. Reimplement all of FreeMat in python
   Pros: Build and maintenance becomes easier
   Cons: Not clear how Matlab syntax fits with Python

3. Add Python as an extension to FreeMat
   Pros: Can use all of python ecosystem from within FreeMat
   	 Can reimplement core functions in Python
   Cons: Maintenance becomes harder, not easier.
   	 No real speed advantage from using Python

4. Keep front end parser in C++, generate Python code
   Pros: Faster than 2
   Cons: Still unclear how matlab and python interact.

Let's try it...

What about linking the two, and then gradually migrating stuff to Python?
