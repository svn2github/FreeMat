</ol>

<h2>2007-04-14  FreeMat 3.1 Released</h2>

<p>The latest version of FreeMat (3.1) has just been released. Beyond the usual bug fixes, this version of FreeMat includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new Threading API, which allows you to take advantage of multi-core and multi-processor machines from within your FreeMat programs.</li>
<li>You can also perform powerful Perl-style regular expression manipulations in 3.1 using the regexp command, and its variants.</li>
<li>A new, unified multi-platform regression test suite is now shipped with FreeMat (as the run_tests command), which allows you to verify the functionality of your installation.</li>
<li>Plotting functions have been improved through the use of an explicit double-buffering technique which eliminates flicker during plot updates. Note that to increase compatibility with MATLAB, you must now include explicit drawnow commands to get updates within scripts.</li>
<li>FreeMat also has new functions for reading URLs, and parsing HTML and XML files.</li>
<li>The help window has a search tool now to help you quickly locate functions and help topics.</li>
<li>The memory usage of FreeMat has been significantly improved - so that FreeMat operates with less memory and should run faster than previous versions.</li>
<li>Also, you can now specify a script startup.m that is automatically executed at startup time.</li>
