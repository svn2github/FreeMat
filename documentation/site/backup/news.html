<h2 id='latest_news__20070923__freemat_35_released'>Latest News - 2007-09-23 - FreeMat 3.5 Released</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of FreeMat 3.5. This is primarily a bugfix release that adds a few new features. Here is the list of changes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed path detection problem on win32 (forward vs backward slashes)</li>

<li>Added ability to change the scrollback length via edit-&gt;preferences menu</li>

<li>Fixed diary command so that commands are echoed as well as their outputs</li>

<li>Fixed diary so that the commands are echoed as well as the outputs.</li>

<li>Added fflush command.</li>

<li>Added ctrl-w to clear the current line</li>

<li>Changed sort algorithm to a stable one.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in linspace</li>

<li>Added the new ctype interface - thanks to Scott McOlash for suggesting it, and GE Global Research for letting us release it under the GPL.</li>

<li>Converted FFTW to estimate mode from measure mode - should fix problems with long FFT times for large FFTs</li>

<li>Added stack trace on errors, even when not in dbauto on mode.</li>

<li>Improved the autoconfig script for mac builds.</li>

<li>Moved loadlib and import to external documentation section</li>

<li>Added external section to the documentation</li>

<li>Changed the default mode for &#8220;image&#8221; command&#8221; to &#8220;scaled&#8221; instead of &#8220;direct&#8221;. This is less compatible with MATLAB, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s unreasonably so.</li>

<li>Added &#8220;edit&#8221; command.</li>

<li>Changed default type for zero function to double precision.</li>

<li>Added imagesc command. Modified image command to show un-scaled images.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='20070805__freemat_33_released'>2007-08-05 - FreeMat 3.3 Released</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of FreeMat 3.3. Available for download from <a href='http://freemat.sf.net' title='Download from SourceForge'>SourceForge</a>. Here is a brief summary of the new features in this version:</p>

<ol>
<li>The output format for FreeMat is now closer to MATLABs, and can be adjusted using the format command.</li>

<li>The console window has been rewritten, and should be more robust and faster.</li>

<li>Contour plots in 2D and 3D are now supported, along with labels.</li>

<li>Anonymous functions are now supported.</li>

<li>Nested functions are now supported</li>

<li>Audio record/playback functionality has been added via the wavplay/wavrecord/etc. functions.</li>

<li>Memory usage has been improved. FreeMat should use less memory than previous versions.</li>

<li>Performance improvements.</li>

<li>Many new functions added. See the detailed change list for the complete list.</li>

<li>Bug fixes. See the detailed change list for the complete list.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='20070414_freemat_31_released'>2007-04-14 FreeMat 3.1 Released</h2>

<p>The latest version of FreeMat (3.1) has just been released. Beyond the usual bug fixes, this version of FreeMat includes</p>

<ul>
<li>A new Threading API, which allows you to take advantage of multi-core and multi-processor machines from within your FreeMat programs.</li>

<li>You can also perform powerful Perl-style regular expression manipulations in 3.1 using the regexp command, and its variants.</li>

<li>A new, unified multi-platform regression test suite is now shipped with FreeMat (as the run_tests command), which allows you to verify the functionality of your installation.</li>

<li>Plotting functions have been improved through the use of an explicit double-buffering technique which eliminates flicker during plot updates. Note that to increase compatibility with MATLAB, you must now include explicit drawnow commands to get updates within scripts.</li>

<li>FreeMat also has new functions for reading URLs, and parsing HTML and XML files.</li>

<li>The help window has a search tool now to help you quickly locate functions and help topics.</li>

<li>The memory usage of FreeMat has been significantly improved - so that FreeMat operates with less memory and should run faster than previous versions.</li>

<li>Also, you can now specify a script startup.m that is automatically executed at startup time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='20070114__freemat_30_released'>2007-01-14 - FreeMat 3.0 Released</h2>

<p>The current release of FreeMat is 3.0. It represents a significant improvement over the prior release (2.0). Here is a partial list of the changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>MATLAB-style GUIs and Widgets</li>

<li>Speed improvements (loops and indexing operations are 10 to 100 times faster)</li>

<li>A new parser that recognizes more of the MATLAB syntax</li>

<li>A debugger that is integrated with the editor</li>

<li>Support for 64-bit integers</li>

<li>Improved MAT-file support</li>

<li>Universal binary support for Mac OS X</li>

<li>New graph/plot tools to rotate, zoom and pan plots.</li>
