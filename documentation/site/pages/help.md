There are several sources to get help for FreeMat :

> %FREEMAT\_HOME%/help

 * Built-in interactive help (Online Help), from the FreeMat Console by typing:

 * Online Documentation published on [this site](http://sourceforge.net/help/index.html).
 * A Google Group (Forum) for **user support**. It is open to anyone to join and read, but you must be a member to post, and posts are moderated (necessary after the spam-bots took over the old sourceforge mailing list). The website for the URL is [http://groups.google.com/group/freemat](http://groups.google.com/group/freemat) . The e-mail address for the group is freemat@googlegroups.com.
 * A Google Group (Forum) for **develper support**. The website for the URL is [http://groups.google.com/group/freemat-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/freemat-devel). The e-mail address for the group is freemat-devel@googlegroups.com.
 * Bug reports should be filed in the: [SourceForge Bug Tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=91526&atid=597446)
 * Feature requests should be filed in the: [Sourceforge Feature Request Tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=91526&atid=597449)
